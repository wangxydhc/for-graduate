Safety assessments are performed in practice, and system certification according to a standard requires the submitting information about the software. The airworthiness standard, RTCA DO-178B, is the software de-facto standard for commercial and military aerospace  programmes.  The  objective  of  this research is to propose  an  approach  to improve the line of communication between safety engineers and software engineers by proposing a Unified Modeling Language (UML) profile that allows software engineers to model safety related concepts and properties in UML, the de-facto software modeling language. In this research, the list of safety-related concepts is extracted from RTCA DO-<br/>178B, and then a UML profile is presented to enable modeling them. Then, approaches to generate certification-related information from UML models are presented. This new approach  is  illustrated  through  a  case  study  on  developing  an  aircraft’s  navigation controller subsystem.</p><h4>Keywords:  <span class="p">UML,  UML  Profile,  Airworthiness,

Decermber 2006</p><h2>1   INTRODUCTION</h2><h3>1.1   Safety and UML</h3><p>Software’s role in various systems has been rapidly increasing over past several decades. Its purpose is no longer restricted to managing financial or mathematical data. Due to the technological advances of computer processors, memory and other components, discrete hardware components in many systems have been replaced by software. Putting software on aircrafts, for example, has become significantly more affordable than it used to be. As a result, software now directly affects human life by managing flights, airplanes, ships, nuclear reactors, medical systems, and many others. This led to increased emphasis on the quality of software used in such systems. This emphasis focused on many aspects. First, it led to improved software verification and testing methods to detect software bugs before the software is delivered and deployed in its target system. However, it was accepted  that  software  can  never  be  100%  correct  and  error  free.  Therefore,  fault tolerance emerged as a design technique to increase the reliability of the software. The principles of fault tolerance focus on adding protection mechanisms to detect software failures within a specified software boundary such that the software is able to recover and continue  execution  despite  the  presence  of  software  faults  or  bugs.  Therefore,  fault tolerance aims at reducing the likelihood that the software becomes unavailable due to software bugs.<br/>However, it was observed that highly reliable software is not necessarily safe within the context of the system in which it is used. Software is safe if it does not contribute to hazards within the context of the system in which it is used, and a system is safe if it does not cause accidents to or harm its environment. In particular, software may be reliable but unsafe when any of the following conditions occurs [1]:<br/>1.   The software correctly implements the requirements, but the specified behaviour is unsafe for the system as a whole (i.e. some requirements are unsafe).<br/>2.   Some safety-related requirements are missing (i.e. requirements are incomplete).<br/>10</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>3.   The software implements unintended and unsafe behaviour that is not specified in the requirements.<br/>As a result, emphasis increased on developing safety requirements, whose goal is to ensure the safety of the environment in which the system is used. Safety requirements and constraints are generally the output of safety assessments that are performed on the system in which the software will be used. As a result, proper requirements development is vital towards ensuring safety.<br/>Furthermore, safety-related standards generally require gathering information about the software  that  is  not  necessarily  related  to  the  implementation  of  safety-related requirements. Examples of such information include the use of COTS software and time- related functions such as filters.<br/>UML  is  the  de-facto  standard  language  for  specifying,  modeling,  analyzing,  and documenting software [2]. It is also used in other areas such as modeling systems, hardware, and even business contexts. UML represents a collection of best engineering techniques and practices that have proven successful in modeling large and complex software systems. It is a very important part of the software development process, and is particularly well-suited for developing object-oriented software. It uses mostly graphical notations to express the design of software systems. The benefits of UML include helping project  teams  communicate,  explore  potential  designs,  and  validate  the  software architecture. It also increases the formalism of the software model, which makes the analysis process easier. Furthermore, it is the heart of the Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) initiative [3], whose supporters claim that it is the future of developing software.<br/>UML is an extensible modeling language; it allows developers to add semantics to the UML language that are applicable in a particular domain, area, or industry. Such added semantics are called a “UML Profile”, which in effect tailor the UML language to a specific area of interest such as, for example, fault tolerance, distributed computing, and Common Object Resource Broker Architecture (CORBA). A UML profile extends the core UML language by defining additional modeling mechanisms of the following types:<br/>11</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>1.   <i>Stereotypes: </i>A stereotype is used to describe a UML element in a platform  or domain specific language.<br/>2.   <i>Constraints: </i>A constraint is a condition or a restriction that is applied to a UML element. It can be expressed in any language, regardless on whether it is machine- readable or not.<br/>3.   <i>Tagged Value: </i>A tagged value is used to further describe a stereotyped-element through  parameterization  of  the  stereotype  in  a  platform  or  domain  specific language.</p><h3>1.2   Research Problem</h3><p>Safety assessments are performed on the system as a whole regardless of which of its features  will  be  implemented  in  software.  As  a  result,  safety  requirements  are  first developed  for  the  system  itself.  Once  it  is  determined  which  functionality  will  be implemented in software, the safety requirements associated with that functionality are allocated to the software that implements it.<br/>Moreover, software certification authorities require information about the software that is not necessarily captured within the safety requirements. Such information could include the use of COTS software, time-related functions as filters, state machines, and others. The certification authorities consider this information along with the safety requirements when determining whether the software is safe or not.<br/>Generally, safety engineers that perform the safety assessments and collect certification information are not the software engineers that design and implement the software. In fact, it is uncommon to find software engineers that are experienced with the safety and certification aspects of systems and software. Conversely, safety engineers are often inexperienced with software engineering’s development techniques, including UML. This creates a critical gap that must be bridged – safety engineers need to have better insight into the software and to what extent it is compliant with the safety and certification requirements, and software engineers need to have better understanding of the safety and<br/>12</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>certification requirements so that they develop safe software that can run in a certified system.<br/>In  this  research,  the  airworthiness  standard  [4],  which  is  the  de-facto  safety-related standard in the aerospace industry, is analyzed to extract a list of safety-related concepts that are of interest to both safety engineers and software engineers. It is argued that if those concepts are properly represented in UML models of software, then a tool can automatically  generate  reports  containing  safety  and  certification-related  information about the software. This gives the safety engineers better insight into the software’s safety and compliance aspects, which they can easily track over time. Those reports could also be used as evidence of software compliance with the airworthiness requirements, and then  presented  to  the  external  certification  authority.  Furthermore,  this  will  increase software engineers’ knowledge of safety-related concepts, which will enable them to implement safer software and better communicate with safety engineers.<br/>To model the safety-related concepts in UML, this research proposed a UML profile that can  be  used  to  model  the  safety-related  information  that  is  extracted  from  the airworthiness standard [4]. The proposed profile contains stereotypes and tagged values that correspond to the safety-related concepts, their attributes that capture the concept details, and the relationships among safety-related concepts. The focus here is modeling safety and certification information in structural diagrams, specifically class diagrams, but the stereotypes and tagged values should be easily transferable to dynamic diagrams such as object diagrams and state charts.</p><h3>1.3   Document Organization</h3><p>Section 1.4 of this document describes the research method that was followed in this research.<br/>Section 2 describes the industrial view of this research. Section 2.1 describes safety assessments in general, and then provides examples of safety requirements and safety assessment techniques.

Section 2.3 presents research findings on the challenges of developing safety-critical software that has certification requirements. Section 2.4 presents and describes usage scenarios for safety information, and  proposes  using  UML  to  model  the  safety  information.  Section  2.5  identifies traceability between software concepts that needs to be tracked. Section 2.6 discusses the rationale, disadvantages, advantages, and requirements of using a UML profile to model safety information.<br/>Section 3 introduces safety-related concepts that are extracted from the airworthiness standard,  RTCA  DO-178B  [4].  Section 3.1  identifies,  describes, and categorizes the safety-related concepts as extracted from the airworthiness standard. Each category is prefixed with “primarily” to indicate that its concepts are related to other categories as well. The concepts are then refined in section 3.2. Section 3.2.1 introduces the conceptual model describing the refined concepts. Section 3.2.2 describes each concept in detail, presents their attributes and relationships with other concept, and explains which original safety-related concept from section 3.1 can be represented using each of the refined concepts. Section 3.2.4 explains how the refined concepts, and their conceptual model, satisfy the required traceability explained in section 2.5. Section 3.3 identifies precise information requirements that a suitable UML profile should be able to model.<br/>Section 4 presents some of the existing UML profiles and patterns and assesses each one of  them  versus  the  information  requirements  identified  in  section  3.3.  Section  4.1 introduces  the  “UML  Profile  for  Modeling  Quality  of  Service  and  Fault  Tolerance Characteristics and Mechanism” [5], which is an Object Management Group’s (OMG) UML profile that enables modeling some safety and fault tolerance concepts. Section 4.2 introduces the “UML Profile for Schedulability, Performance, and Time Specification” [6], which enables modeling some concepts that are usually important in safety-critical software such as performance and concurrency. Section 4.3 introduces a UML profile that was developed by a European research project that specialized in developing high- integrity real-time systems [26]. Section 4.4 introduces a UML profile that was developed by a researcher who argued that safety is often related to messages across software components  [27].  Section  4.5  introduces  patterns  that  can  be  used  to  model  some<br/>14</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>reliability and safety concepts such as software redundancy. Section 4.6 summarizes the overall suitability of each profile with respect to the information requirements identified in section 3.3.<br/>Section 5 presents a new UML Profile, one for modeling safety-related concepts listed in section 3.2, and provides examples of its usage. Section 5.1 presents the UML profile, section  5.3  provides  numerous  examples  of  its  usage,  and  section  5.4  describes  a development methodology for safety-critical systems within which the proposed UML profile can be used.<br/>Section 6 describes how safety certification information can be generated from a UML model where the new UML profile is applied. Section 6.1 describes the technological requirements  that  are  needed  to  be  able  to  generate  such  safety  and  certification information, with sections 6.1.1 and 6.1.2 providing guidance on how such requirements can be achieved. Section 6.1.1 describes how UML modeling tools can be extended to support  generation  of  certification  information,  an  section  6.1.2  introduces  another approach  that  uses  XML  Metadata  Interchange  (XMI)  to  obtain  the  safety  and certification information. Section 6.2 presentes examples of search queries that can be executed on a UML model to generate safety and certification information from the software model.<br/>Section 7 presents a case study of an aircraft’s navigation controller subsystem, which controls the movement of an aircraft by performing autopilot and custom Fly-To-Point (FTP) positions from the pilots. Section 7.1 provides an overview of the system and presents  some  navigation  terminology.  Section  7.2  describes  the  aircraft’s  system architecture in which the navigation controller subsystem appears. Section 7.3 lists the functional requirements of the navigation controller subsystem. Section 7.4 discussed the safety assessment that was performed on the system and lists the identified safety hazards that are relevant to the subsystem under study. Section 7.4.1 lists safety hazards that were identified using the Action Error Analysis (AEA) safety assessment method, section 7.4.2 lists those that were identified using the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method, section 7.4.3 lists those that were identified using the Hazards and Operability<br/>15</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>Analysis (HAZOP) method, and section 7.4.4 lists those that were identified using the Interface  Analyses  (IA)  method.  Section  7.4.5  lists  safety  requirements  that  were assigned  to  the  navigation  controller  subsystem  based  on  the  hazards  identified  in sections 7.4.1 - 7.4.4. Section 7.5 presents the UML model for the subsystem design using the proposed UML profile, with section 7.5.2 showing the subsytem’s safety- related events of interest, section 7.5.3 showing the subsystem’s reactions to those events, section 7.5.4 explicitly listing all the relationships between events and reactions, section<br/>7.5.5 showing the subsystem’s high-level design, and section 7.5.6 presenting approaches to low-level design of events and reactions. Section 7.6 discusses the benefits of the proposed UML profile by analysis the UML model of the subsystem according to the usage scenarios identified in section 2.4.<br/>Section 8 concludes this research by describing the use of the proposed UML profile and identifying open issues for future work. Section 8.1 assesses the UML profile according to the requirements identified in section 2.6.3 the same way existing UML profiles were assessed in section 4. Section 8.2 lists open issues and improvement opportunities for future work.<br/>Section 9 provides a summary of this document.</p><h3>1.4   Research Method</h3><p>This research was performed according to the method described in Figure 1. There is no input or entry criterion for the first step, S-1. The input of each of the other steps is all the outputs from all of its previous steps.

For example, an aircraft must only allow the pilot to hide the landing wheel if it is flying in the air. If the landing wheel was hidden while the aircraft is on ground, then there would be a hazard of damaging the aircraft and hurting its occupants. A hazard is a state of the system that could ultimately lead to an accident that may result in a loss in human life.<br/>Because of such added requirements and constraints, developing safety-critical software is more expensive than developing non-safety-critical software. In fact, it is generally well accepted that developing safety-critical software is at least 10 times more expensive than non-safety-critical software, and some sources claim that it can be 20 to 30 times more expensive [8].<br/>Many standards require that a safety assessment be performed for each safety-critical system. Safety assessments, which have some similarities with risk assessments [1] and are  performed  using  similar  methods,  produce  a  list  of  safety  requirements  and constraints that the system developers must adhere to. Performing a safety assessment is a mandatory and critical element to developing a safety-critical system. Table 2 provides examples of safety requirements and the potential accidents they protect against.</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse"><tr><td><p class="s24">Safety Requirement</p></td><td><p class="s24">Accident Protected Against</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s25">A   submarine   detection   aircraft   may   only release  a  sonobuoy  while  it  is  flying  above water</p></td><td><p class="s25">The   sonobuoy   is   dropped   on   unintended locations and causes unintended damages</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s25">An aircraft’s automatic flight pilot programme may   only   fly   the   aircraft  to   a   particular destination after explicit confirmation from the pilot</p></td><td><p class="s25">The automatic flight pilot programme flies the aircraft   to   incorrect   destinations,   possibly through hazardous flight paths</p></td></tr></table><h4>Table 2: Examples of safety requirements and the accidents they protect against.</h4><p>19</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>There exist many methods for performing a safety or risk assessment. Those methods differ, for instance, in terms of what factors they consider as possible causes of accidents (e.g., operator actions, environment state), the subjects they analyze (e.g., critical events, possible failures), their outputs (e.g., a tree), their scalability. Furthermore, some methods target  reliability  issues  (e.g.,  Failure  Modes  and  Effects  Analysis  (FMEA),  Failure Modes, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), Interface Analyses (IA)) whereas others solely consider safety issues (e.g., State Machine Hazard Analysis (SMHA)), and some consider both (e.g., Event Tree Analysis (ETA)). Most of those methods originated in hardware or system analysis, and some were developed for software. Some consider single events at a time (e.g., FMEA and FMECA), whereas others consider relationships across events (e.g., Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)). Furthermore, some are used to identify potential hazards (e.g., Action Error Analysis (AEA)), whereas others are used to analyze previously identified hazards (e.g., ETA).<br/>Therefore, some of these methods are complimentary to each other, whereas others are similar and overlap. As a result, a project is likely to use several of those methods rather than just one. Examples of those methods are listed in Table 7 of Appendix A. Those methods are discussed in many references, and a summary of them is presented in [1].</p><h3>2.2   Safety-Related Standards</h3><p>Many industrial standards exist for system and software safety. Some are common to all industry sectors (e.g., IEC 61508-3 on software requirements for the functional safety of electrical/electronic/programmable  electronic  systems)  whereas  others  are  industry specific (e.g., CENELEC 50128 for Railway applications). Table 8 of Appendix B lists some of these standards that relate to safety, or reliability due to its relation to safety. Hermann provided a high-level summary for those standards, or some of their earlier versions, in [9].<br/>RTCA DO-178B [4] is the de-facto safety-related standard for developing software to run in aerospace systems. It is also known as the “airworthiness” standard. Consequently, engineers whose responsibilities includes ensuring compliancy with the airworthiness standard are known as “airworthiness engineers”.<br/>20</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>In addition to developing safety-related requirements, standards usually have additional certification-related requirements. Those requirements are not necessarily implemented in software, but rather they represent information about the software that must be submitted to the certification authorities. For example, the airworthiness standard requires that developers  submit  information  regarding  the  COTS  software  used  in  the  system. Moreover, it requires that the developers specify time-related functions, such as filters, that  are  used  in  the  system.  Therefore,  it  is  important  to  be  able  to  gather  such information easily about the software.<br/>DO-178B realizes that not all software components in an airborne system have the same impact on the safety of the aircraft and its occupants. For example, the failure of software that controls the altitude of an aircraft is much less acceptable than the failure of the software that controls the aircraft VCR for watching movies. This is because the failure of the former may significantly reduce the aircraft’s chances of a safe flight. The failure of the latter, however, does not have such effects as long as the VCR is isolated from other safety-critical software. As a result, DO-178B classifies software failure conditions into the following five categories [4]:<br/>1.   <i>Catastrophic: </i>A failure condition of this type would prevent continued safe flight and landing of the aircraft. A software component whose failure may  result in failure condition of this category is known as a level A software component, and is said to have airworthiness level A.</p><p class="s18">2.   Hazardous/Severe-Major:  <span class="p">A  failure  condition  of  this  type  would   introduce operating conditions that would severely reduce the ability of the aircraft crew to cope with them to the extent where there would be large  reductions in system safety, the inability of the crew to perform tasks accurately and completely, and potential fatal injuries. A software component whose failure may result in failure condition of this category is known as a level B software component, and is said to have airworthiness level B.</span></p><p class="s18">3.   Major: <span class="p">A failure condition of this type would introduce operating conditions that would severely reduce the ability of the aircraft crew to cope with them to  the</span></p><p>21</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>extent where there would be significant reductions in system safety and crew efficiency, significant increase in crew workload and occupant discomfort, and potential  injuries.  A  software  component  whose  failure  may  result  in  failure condition of this category is known as a level C software component, and is said to have airworthiness level C.</p><p class="s18">4.   Minor: <span class="p">A failure condition of this type would introduce operating conditions that can be handled by the crew, but may include a slight increase in the  crew’s workload or occupant discomfort, and a slight reduction in safety. A  software component whose failure may result in failure condition of this category is known as a level D software component, and is said to have airworthiness level D.</span></p><p>5.   <i>No Effect: </i>A failure condition of this type does not impact the system safety of the aircraft, nor does it increase the aircraft crew’s workload. A software component whose failure may result in failure condition of this category is known as a level E software component, and is said to have airworthiness level E.<br/>It should be noted, however, that there exists a difference between the concepts of “airworthiness” and “safety”. The airworthiness standard, like many other safety-related standards,  defines  different  levels  of  impact  on  safety  called  “failure  condition categories” and “software levels”. However, it defines the failure condition categories and the software levels based on the “severity of failure conditions on the aircraft and its occupants” [4]. This is different from Leveson’s definition of safety, which was stated as “the freedom from accidents or losses” [1]. While safety is the freedom from accidents or losses, airworthiness is therefore the freedom from accidents or losses with respect to the aircraft and its occupants. Thus, airworthiness is a subset of safety, and safe software is airworthy but airworthy software is not necessarily safe. For example, the first safety requirement  in  Table  2  of  page  19  is  not  necessarily  an  airworthiness  requirement,<br/>whereas the second one is.<br/>22</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><h3>2.3   Challenges in Software Safety</h3><p>The  NASA  Langley  Research  Center,  which  has  long  cooperated  with  the  Federal Aviation  Administration  (FAA)  on  research about  software  engineering  methods  for aerospace applications, conducted a research programme called Streamlining Software Aspects  of  Certification  (SSAC).  This  programme  included  an  extensive  survey  to identify  the  challenges  in  developing  safety-critical  software  for  aerospace  systems. Hayhurst and Holloway have documented results of this research in [10].<br/>Hayhurst and Holloway of the NASA Langley Research Center identified “the challenge of accurately communicating requirements between groups of people” as “the root of many   of   the   current   challenges”   in   software   safety   [10].   They   presented   the communication challenge as a combination of the following two major communication channels:<br/>1.   Between regulatory people (e.g. certification authorities) and systems people (e.g. systems engineers and airworthiness engineers).<br/>2.   Between systems people (e.g. systems engineers and airworthiness engineers) and software people (e.g. software engineers).<br/>Since systems engineers and safety/airworthiness engineers need to communicate with the certification authorities, they need to have insight into the software and its sfety compliance  aspects.  The  fact  that  they  are  unlikely  to  be  experienced  in  software engineering makes their responsibilities even more challenging. Moreover, software is continuously changing and it is likely that the software engineers significantly outnumber safety engineers. Therefore, it is essential to be able to achieve insight into the software’s compliance aspects at relatively low costs. Such insight could be the ability to easily monitor the software engineers’ progress with respect to the safety requirements and the compliance with the certification requirements of the software.<br/>Hayhurst’s  and  Holloway’s  survey  also  found  out  that  “requirements  definition  is difficult” [10]. This undoubtedly contributes to the communication challenges between<br/>23</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>the various people groups. For example, systems engineers may define requirements that software engineers find unusual or expensive. If software engineers better understand the needs behind the requirements, then they may be able to propose solutions that are more cost effective. The software engineers’ misinterpretation of the requirements may also be due to their lack of experience in safety. In fact, their lack of experience in safety often causes them to confuse safety with reliability. In many instances, software engineers cannot clearly define software safety without having prior background knowledge or experience.</p><h3>2.4   Usage Scenarios for Safety Information</h3><p><span><IMG width="450" height="245" src="A UML Profile for Developing Airworthiness-Compliant (RTCA DO-178B), Safety-Critical Software/Image_014.png"/></span><br/>Based  on  the  discussion  in  sections  2.1  -  2.3,  safety  information  is  used  by  many stakeholders as described in the use case diagram in Figure 2.</p><p class="s19">Usage Scenarios for Safety Information</p><p class="s19">USAGE 1</p><p class="s19">Provide Safety</p><p class="s19">Requirements</p><p class="s19">USAGE 2</p><p class="s19">Design Safety Requirements in Systems</p><p class="s19">Safety Engineers</p><p class="s19">Airworthiness Engineers</p><p class="s19">Certification Authorities</p><p class="s19">(3<span class="s26">rd </span>Parties)</p><p class="s19">USAGE 4</p><p class="s19">Monitor Safety</p><p class="s19">USAGE 5</p><p class="s19">Get Safety</p><p class="s19">Information</p><p class="s19">USAGE 3</p><p class="s19">Record and Justify</p><p class="s19">Design Decisions</p><p class="s19">Software Engineers</p><h4>Figure 2: Usage scenarios for safety information.</h4><p>The usage scenarios are:<br/>USAGE 1    <i>Provide   Safety   Requirements:   </i>Safety   and   airworthiness   engineers perform a safety assessment of the system being designed or modified. As discussed in section 2.1, such a safety  assessment results in safety requirements,  a  subset  of  which  will  be  allocated  to  software  and communicated to the software engineers.  The software engineers will then  design  and  implement  the   software   according  to  the  safety<br/>24</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>information and requirements. Thus, this usage scenario represents the process  of  communicating  safety  information  from  the  safety  and airworthiness engineers to the software engineers.<br/>USAGE 2    <i>Design Safety Requirements in Systems: </i>Once the software engineers are informed with the safety requirements allocated to software, they design the software system with the safety requirements  in mind. Then, they implement it such that it meets all the safety  requirements. Thus, this usage scenario represents the process of designing and implementing the software system according to the safety requirements.<br/>USAGE 3    <i>Justify Design Decisions: </i>Not only must the software engineers design the software to meet the safety requirements, but they must justify their design decisions as well. Such justification should explain the rationale for  the  architecture  and  design  details.  In  practice,  architectural  and major design decisions are documented in  separate documents, which makes it separate from the software model. Furthermore, detailed design decisions normally appear as plain text  comments in the source code, which makes it hard for safety and  airworthiness engineers to obtain justifications for the various design decisions. Thus, this usage scenario represents the process of justifying and documenting design decisions so that they can be easily obtained in the future.<br/>USAGE 4    <i>Monitor  Safety:  </i>The  safety  and  airworthiness  engineers  continuously monitor  the  safety  of  the  system,  including  the  software,  over  the project’s lifecycle. In order to do so, they need  to  consider how the software engineers designed the software  (USAGE  2) according to the safety requirements they were provided with (USAGE 1). The software engineers’ justifications for the design decisions (USAGE 3) will also be considered. Then, the safety and airworthiness engineers can assess this information  and  discuss  any  issue  with  the  software  engineers.  This ensures that the software’s safety is continuously improving during the<br/>25</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>software’s lifecycle so that it meets the final safety objectives of the system. In addition, this usage scenario provides additional confidence that the system certification process will go more smoothly. Thus, this usage scenario represents the process of continuously monitoring the design  and  implementation  of  the  software  in  accordance  with  the system’s overall safety requirements.<br/>USAGE 5    <i>Get Safety Information: </i>Once it is time to certify the  system, which is usually  towards  the  end  of  the  development   lifecycle,  safety  and certification information is submitted to the certification authorities. This information includes the safety  requirements (USAGE 1), the software design (USAGE 2), the justification of the software design (USAGE 3) given the safety  requirements of the software, and the process used to continuously   monitor   the   system   and   software   safety   over   the development lifecycle (USAGE 4). If safety and airworthiness engineers continuously  and appropriately monitor safety over time (USAGE 4), then certification should be a much easier experience. Thus, this usage scenario  represents  the  process  of  obtaining  the  appropriate  safety information, system and software design, justification of the design from a safety perspective, and the method used for monitoring safety during the development lifecycle for the purpose of submitting this information to the certificatrion authorities.<br/>If the safety information is captured in a UML model, then this would easily facilitate the above mentioned usage scenarios. UML models are developed for software systems anyways,  so  using  it  to  facilitate  the  usage  scenarios  and  address  the  challenges  in software safety fits well (this is rationalized further in section 2.6). Therefore, a UML model can serve a central role as shown in Figure 3.<br/>26</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p class="s27">Monitor</p><p class="s27">Safety Engineers</p><p class="s27">Airworthiness Engineers</p><p class="s27">UML Model</p><p class="s27">Record</p><p class="s27">Get</p><p class="s27">Software Engineers</p><p><span><IMG width="337" height="168" src="A UML Profile for Developing Airworthiness-Compliant (RTCA DO-178B), Safety-Critical Software/Image_015.png"/></span></p><p class="s27">Certification Authorities</p><p class="s27">(3<span class="s28">rd </span>Parties)</p><h4>Figure 3: A UML model serves as a central role for stakeholders.</h4><p>As Figure 3 shows, a UML model can serve as a central role and a key element in the communication  of  safety  information  across  engineering  groups.  Software  engineers record safety information in UML models. Then, safety and airworthiness engineers can monitor the safety information by automatically generating reports about it, using a tool, from the UML model. Therefore, they need not understand the UML model because any tool  that  extracts  the  safety  information  from  the  model  can  format  it  in  a  model- independent way. When it is time to certify the system, certification authorities can get the safety and certification information from the UML model, again, using a tool which could produce the safety and certification information in a format that is suitable for submission to the certification authorities.</p><h3>2.5   Traceability Requirements</h3><p>Proper traceability is key in the development of large systems, and it is even more important for the development of safety-critical systems. For example, the airworthiness DO-178B standard [4] requires traceability across the development lifecycle. In fact, it requires  that  at  least  the  software  design  be  traceable  to  the  original  high-level requirements for all software of level D or higher. Therefore, it is important to be able to trace design elements to the requirements.<br/>Another important traceability requirement relates to the analysis of safety requirements. For example, the first requirement in Table 2 states: A submarine detection aircraft may only release a sonobuoy while it is flying above water. This can be rephrased to: The<br/>27</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>ordnance (sonobuoy release) subsystem shall not release a sonobuoy if it is requested to do so when the aircraft is not flying above water. This results in identifying the following event of interest: The ordnance subsystem is requested to release a sonobuoy when the aircraft is not flying above water. Furthermore, this also results in identifying a reaction to this event, namely: The ordnance subsystem verifies that the aircraft is flying above water, and forbids the sonobuoy from being released if it is not flying above water. Since reactions are caused by events, it is important to ensure that every reaction is traceable to the appropriate events<br/>In summary, two important traceability requirements are:<br/>1.   Tracing software design elements to software requirements.<br/>2.   Tracing software reactions to software events.</p><h3>2.6   UML APPROACH</h3><p>Because the results of safety assessments are an important part of software developers’ work, they need to be appropriately communicated and implemented in the technical designs. Furthermore, certification information about the software is required for the certification authorities. It is appropriate and useful to be able to represent the results of safety  assessments  and  certification  information  in  UML  diagrams  because  it  is  the standard  modeling  language  used  by  software  developers  throughout  the  world  [2]. Currently, there does not seem to be a comprehensive UML profile specifically targeted towards modeling safety-related concepts driven from safety standards (see section 4). If it existed, such a UML profile would help bridge the gap between the system’s safety assessment  (performed  by  safety  engineers)  and  the  software  design  (performed  by software engineers). The safety engineers need not necessarily understand the UML profile, but they will need the information that is reprented by the profile. See Figure 4 for an illustration.<br/>28</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p class="s29">Safety and Airworthiness engineers produce a list of safety requirements and certification information</p><p class="s29">Software and system engineers use UML to model their systems, which must conform to the safety and certification requirements</p><p class="s29">Generate Safety Requirements and Certification Information</p><p class="s29">Information Flow</p><p class="s29">Use Unified Modeling Language (UML)</p><p class="s29">Safety Engineers</p><p class="s29">Airworthiness Engineers</p><p class="s29">An appropriate UML safety profile bridges this gap by allowing software and system engineers to include safety requirements and certification</p><p class="s29">information in their UML models.

Therefore, this approach will be an additional step to most software development processes.<br/>2.   <i>Requires that software engineers consider a topic they are likely to have  little experience in – safety: </i>Safety is a specialized topic of software engineering. Since software engineers may come from backgrounds where they were  developing non-safety-critical   systems,   they   may   not   have   sufficient   knowledge   and experience in this topic.</p><h4>2.6.2    Advantages</h4><p>Using this approach has the following advantages:<br/>1.   <i>Results in safer and higher quality software: </i>By representing safety requirements and constraints on UML diagrams, the engineers are forced to consider them and use them to design and implement the systems.<br/>29</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>2.   <i>Enables  the  possibility  of  reusing  the  results  of  a  safety  assessment  through software models: </i>Performing a safety assessment, like a risk assessment, is costly and time consuming. Therefore, representing the results of a safety assessment on UML diagrams allows it to be reused whenever the design is  reused instead of reassessing the new or modified system from scratch. This is important when an organization is designing similar systems.<br/>3.   <i>Improves  communication  between  safety  engineers  and  software   engineers: S</i>oftware developers will have a better understanding of the safety  engineers’ requirements. This will allow software engineers to better understand and review the results of the safety assessment. As a result, software engineers will be able to provide feedback regarding the safety assessment.<br/>4.   <i>Improves documentation of safety-related properties: </i>Appropriate documentation is  required  by  many  standards  including  the  MIL-STD-498   [11],  and  its replacement IEEE/EIA 12207 [12], which is one of the most referenced software development  documentation  standards.  Documenting  the  results  of  a  safety assessment in UML provides a step in that direction.<br/>5.   <i>Increases  participation  of  software  engineers  in  the  safety  assessment:  </i>This approach  drives  software  engineers  to  think  about  the  results  of  the  safety assessment  because  it  is  represented  in  UML. Therefore, they will  implicitly perform additional analyses as part of their job to design and  implement the software.  As  a  result,  they  may  discover  additional  safety  requirements  and constraints,  which  can  then  be  communicated  back  to  the  safety  assessment process.<br/>6.   <i>Increases  level  of  formalism:  </i>The  results  of  the  safety  assessment  will  be represented using methods that are more formal than plain text English. This helps introduce the benefits of using formal methods, such as being able to  detect conflicting or ambiguous requirements. In addition, this will make it  easier for tools to use this information to help the engineers design, implement, and verify systems.<br/>30</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>7.   <i>Maps  safety-related  properties  to  source  code:  </i>This  approach  allows  safety- related properties to be represented in UML models. In the software development process, the source code is directly traceable to UML models.  Therefore, this approach allows safety-related properties to be mapped to the source code through the UML designs. This improves traceability, which is  often  required by many standards and is critical in large programmes.<br/>8.   <i>Lower cost to use since UML is known in the software community: </i>A UML safety profile  builds  on  the  engineers’  knowledge  of  UML.  Therefore,  there  is  no additional cost to train the software engineers to use UML. They only need to be aware of the UML profile specifics and how it builds on top of UML. This should be inexpensive as software engineers should already be experienced  with  UML and the tools that support it.<br/>9.   <i>Emphasizes a “develop in safety” culture: </i>In her book on software safety  [1], Nancy   Leveson   stressed   the   need   for   a   “develop   in   safety”   culture   in organizations. This UML approach emphasizes Leveson’s point as it involves the software engineers and developers in the safety aspects of the software.<br/>10. <i>Supports the MDA initiative: </i>The MDA initiative [3] is a promising  approach that, in conjunction with UML, seems to be the future of software development. It argues that design should be modeled appropriately first, which then allows the engineers to forward-generate the implementation (e.g. software  code) from the high-level designs using appropriate computer tools. This is a very active research area  that  is projected to  be  the  future of the development  process  as it  will increase the level of automation. Such a UML profile allows describing the safety aspects in the software model, which would in turn be used in the MDA approach.<br/>11. <i>Makes life of engineers easier: </i>For the engineers, this means that relevant safety information will be represented in a language that they understand, namely UML, rather than having to read other informal documents that risk being ambiguous.<br/>31</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><h4>2.6.3    Requirements of an Effective UML Profile</h4><p>Based on the previous discussion, we identify that the requirements of an effective UML<br/>profile are:<br/>REQ 1    <i>The profile shall provide insight into the software’s compliance aspects with airworthiness, and such evidence of compliance shall be obtainable at low costs: </i>In essence, the cumulative cost of training the  engineers to use the profile  and  extracting  regular  software  compliance  reports  for  progress tracking  shall  be  less  than  the  cost  of  collecting  software  compliance evidence when the profile is not used.<br/>REQ 2    <i>The profile shall allow the software engineers to relate technical solutions to the specific airworthiness requirements: </i>Therefore, it shall be possible to exactly  determine  the  software  design  and  source  code  units  that  are responsible for satisfying each airworthiness requirement.<br/>REQ 3    <i>The profile shall have clear language semantics with respect to safety and airworthiness:  </i>For  example,  the  profile  shall  not  assume  that  safety  is simply reliability or some other concept – it shall  recognize safety and airworthiness  as  a  separate  quality  domain.   This   will  enable  better representation of requirements as well as  improve the software engineers’ understanding and ability to distinguish between safety and other concepts such as reliability.<br/>REQ 4    <i>The   profile   shall   model   technical   solutions   using   machine-readable extension mechanisms that increase the level of formalism: </i>In other words, specific  domain  stereotypes,  tags,  and  constraints  shall  be  preferable  to general purpose comments. In addition, the extensions shall allow software engineers  to  identify  various  kinds  of  technical  solutions.

For example, level C and above require tracing  source  code  to  low-level  requirements  and   tracing  low-level requirements to high-level requirements, whereas levels  D and E do not have  such  requirements  [4].  As  another  example,  high  software  levels require checking that requirements are compatible with the target computers on which the software is deployed. Refer to  annex A in [4] for a list of objectives per software level.<br/>REQ 6    <i>The profile shall favour language semantics that are  meaningful  to both software  engineers  and  airworthiness  engineers  for  concepts  that  both engineering   groups   need   to   discuss:   </i>Therefore,    it   will   improve communication between the two groups.<br/>REQ 7    <i>The  profile  shall  favour  representing  airworthiness  requirements  using machine-readable  extension  mechanisms:  </i>Thus,  it   shall  define  some airworthiness-specific    stereotypes,    tags,    and     constraints    that    are parameterizable. Again, this is particularly useful when developing software under high-software levels because that is when formal methods are more likely to be used due to their ability to prove correctness. In addition, this is<br/>also useful when models are to be reused across projects.<br/>33</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><h2>3   SAFETY-RELATED CONCEPTS</h2><p>This  section  describes  airworthiness-related  concepts  that  were  extracted  from  the airworthiness standard, RTCA DO-178B [4]. Since airworthiness is a subset of safety (see end of section 2.2), all of the identified airworthiness-related concepts are safety- related concepts. This does not necessarily mean that those concepts are the only ones needed for all safety-critical applications including transportation, medical, nuclear, and other  industries.  However,  they  should  be  enough  for  any  development  under  the airworthiness standard [4], which is the goal of this research.<br/>Since airworthiness is a subset of safety, airworthiness-related concepts will be referred to with their general term, safety-related concepts, in the remainder of this document. This  is  to  emphasize  that  they  are  not  restricted  to  airworthiness  even  though  they resulted from analysing the airworthiness standard.<br/>Ensuring software safety has many concerns that impact other qualities of service. As a result, the extracted safety-related concepts form a long list of concepts related to many concerns and qualities of service. Hence, it is important to group concepts that are most related together, which will also improve clarity and give the reader the general goal of each concept. For example, consider the following safety-related requirement:</p><p class="s18">An aircraft shall ensure that its landing wheels are deployed when the aircraft’s altitude is less than 100 meters</p><p>The following concerns are relevant for designing and implementing the safety-critical software assigned with the above requirement:<br/>1.   It must be <i>safe </i>so that the aircraft does not hit the ground with the landing wheels not deployed (i.e. when they are in their compartments). Software  safety  is the ability of the software to execute within its system context without contributing to hazards, which may lead to accidents or losses [1].<br/>34</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>2.   It must be <i>reliable </i>so that it correctly implements the requirement by  ensuring that  landing  wheels  are  deployed  when  the  altitude  is  less  than  100  meters. Software reliability is the capability of the software system to offer  continued service, or more specifically to maintain a specified level of performance when used under specified conditions [5].<br/>3.   It must have high <i>integrity </i>by providing precise and accurate results so that  an altitude of less than 100 meters is not interpreted to be larger than 100 meters (and thus  causing  the  aircraft  not  to  deploy  its  wheels  when  it  should).  Software integrity is the capability of the software system to produce the expected quality of service of the correct functionality delivered by the software [5].<br/>4.   It  must  have  high  <i>performance  </i>capabilities,  so  that  the  landing  wheels  are deployed when the aircraft’s altitude drops to less than 100 meters even when it does so quickly in a fast descent such as the case in an emergency.  Software performance refers to the timeliness aspects of how software systems behave, and sometimes it refers to the relationship between the services  provided and the utilization of resources [5].<br/>5.   It must provide <i>concurrent </i>control so that the landing wheels are deployed even if pilot is already using the system to perform other functionality through the user interface. Software concurrency refers to the concurrent and temporal consistency of data and software elements [5].<br/>6.   It must be <i>certifiable </i>as vendors of such safety-critical systems often require them to be certified by an external third-party certification authority. Certification is the legal recognition by the certification authority that a product, service, organization or person complies with the requirements [4].<br/>7.   It must be properly <i>designed </i>so that non-critical software, such as a  language dictionary, is decoupled from highly safety-critical software, such as the software interfacing  with  the  landing  wheels  and  the  altitude  sensors,  to  ensure  that software bugs in non-critical software do not cause the critical software to fail.<br/>35</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>8.   It must be independent of the various software <i>configurations </i>that may be loaded into  the  system  to  configure  it  such  as  English  and  French  dictionaries  to customize the user interface. Software configuration, which is  not the same as software configuration management, is the concept of having  multiple software configurations or settings, each of which has a different set of functionalities and behaviours than the others.<br/>Notice that while the concerns above describe various software quality categories, they all contribute to safety in some way. With that in mind, it is important to classify all of the extracted safety-related concepts into quality categories that best describe each related group of concepts. Those categories help the reader have a better understanding of the general goal of each concept, and they provide guidance on what to look for when attempting to describe a specific concept.</p><h3>3.1   Concept Identification and Categorization</h3><p>The selected standard, the airworthiness RTCA DO-178B standard [4], was analysed and a list of safety-related concepts was extracted. Those safety-related concepts are not solely safety concepts, and hence the rationale behind using the term “safety-related concepts” rather than simply “safety concepts” – in fact, many of those concepts are primarily  non-safety  concepts,  such  as  reliability  concepts,  fault-tolerance  concepts, certification concepts, and others. The “primarily” keyword identifies the category with which a concept is most associated. For example, fault tolerance is associated with reliability and, therefore, is a primarily reliability concept that also affects safety in some way.<br/>To clarify and group related concepts together, the extracted safety-related concepts are classified in this research into the following safety-related quality categories:<br/>1.   <i>Primarily  safety  concepts:  </i>The  concepts  listed  in  this  category  are  software concepts that describe the software’s safety aspects in the context of the system in which it is used. Software safety is the ability of the software to execute within its system context without contributing to hazards, which may lead to accidents or<br/>36</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>losses [1]. Examples of these concepts include safety-monitoring techniques and software  levels.  These  concepts  are  listed  and  described  in  section  C.1  of Appendix C.<br/>2.   <i>Primarily reliability concepts: </i>The concepts listed in this category are software concepts  that  describe  the  software’s  reliability  aspects.  However,  they  also impact the safety of the software because of the relationship between software’s reliability and safety – reliability measures the probability of  failure,  whereas safety measures the consequences of those failures [5]. Software reliability is the capability of the software system to offer continued service, or more specifically to maintain a specified level of performance when used under specified conditions [5]. Examples of primarily reliability concepts include  exception handling and fault  tolerance.  These  concepts  are  listed  and  described  in  section  C.2  of Appendix C.<br/>3.   <i>Primarily integrity concepts: </i>The concepts listed in this category are  software concepts that describe the software’s integrity aspects. However, they also impact the safety of the software because of the relationship between software’s integrity and safety. Software integrity is the capability of the software system to produce the  expected  quality  of  service  of  the  correct  functionality  delivered  by  the software  [5].  Examples  of  primarily  integrity  concepts  include  accuracy  and precision: Inaccurate data may cause the safety-critical system to behave in a non- safe way. As an example, consider an aircraft the needs to know when to deploy the landing wheels – it must have  an  accurate value of the altitude so that it deploys  the  landing  wheels  when  it  should.  These  concepts  are  listed  and described in section C.3 of Appendix C.<br/>4.   <i>Primarily performance concepts: </i>The concepts listed in this category are software concepts that describe the software’s performance aspects. However,  they also impact the safety of the software because of the relationship between software’s performance and safety. Software performance refers to the timeliness aspects of how software systems behave, and sometimes it refers to the relationship between<br/>37</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>the  services  provided  and  the  utilization  of  resources  [5].  In  this  document, performance  concepts  include  schedulability  and  time  concepts.  Examples  of primarily performance concepts include scheduling strategies (e.g. round robin, rate monotonic) and time-related (e.g. filters) functions. For example, an aircraft’s scheduling software must schedule safety-critical tasks with priorities higher than non safety-critical tasks. These concepts are listed and described in section C.4 of Appendix C.<br/>5.   <i>Primarily concurrency concepts: </i>The concepts listed in this category are software concepts that describe the software’s concurrency aspects. However,  they also impact the safety of the software because of the relationship between software’s concurrency  and  safety.  Software  concurrency  refers  to  the  concurrent  and temporal consistency of data and software elements [5].  Examples of primarily concurrency  concepts  include  multi-tasking  and  active  software  components, which may be safety-critical. These concepts are listed and described in section C.5 of Appendix C.<br/>6.   <i>Primarily certification concepts: </i>The concepts listed in this category are software concepts that describe the software’s certification aspects. However,  they also impact the safety of the software because of the relationship between software’s certification and safety. Certification is the legal recognition by the certification authority  that  a  product,  service,  organization  or  person  complies  with  some requirements. Such certification comprises the activity of technically checking the product, service, organization or person and the formal recognition of compliance with the applicable requirements by issue of a certificate,  license, approval or other documents as required by national laws and  procedures [4]. Examples of primarily certification concepts include certification requirements (e.g. specifying hardware/software interfaces) and software traceability. These concepts are listed and described in section C.6 of Appendix C.<br/>7.   <i>Primarily  design  concepts:  </i>The  concepts  listed  in  this  category  are  software concepts that describe the software’s design aspects. However, they also impact<br/>38</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>the safety of the software because of the relationship between software’s design and  safety.  These  generally  impact  areas  such  as  the  quality,  clarity,  and maintainability of the model and the source code. The impact of these decisions on the use of the end product is usually less defined than those of other quality categories. Examples of primarily design concepts include software coupling and software complexity. These concepts are listed and described in section C.7 of Appendix C.<br/>8.   <i>Primarily  configuration  concepts:  </i>The  concepts  listed  in  this  category   are software concepts that describe the software’s configuration aspects.  However, they  also  impact  the  safety  of  the  software  because  developing   multiple- configuration software is more challenging than developing single configuration software due to the changing behaviour. As a result, it is more challenging to fully predict the behaviour of the software, especially when the user of the software can change the configuration (e.g. by changing memory bits or  loading customized look  up  tables).  Software  configuration,  which  is  not  the  same  as  software configuration   management,   is   the   concept   of   having   multiple   software configurations or settings, each of which has a different set of functionalities and behaviours than the others. Choosing the desired software configuration is usually performed by the user rather than the software developer. Examples of primarily configuration  concepts  include  option-selectable  software  and  user-modifiable software. These concepts are listed and described in section C.8 of Appendix C.<br/>An 8-dimensional space is needed to fully describe the relationships across all safety- related quality categories identified above. For simplicity, let us assume that reliability, integrity, performance, concurrency, certification, design, and configuration concepts sets form mutually exclusive sets. If we fix values for 6 dimensions, then we can arrive at a 2- dimensional  view  that  shows  the  relationship  between  safety  and  each  of  the  other identified safety-related quality categories independently of their cross relationships. This view is somehow simplistic but it is useful for illustration purposes. It is shown in Figure<br/>5 below.<br/>39</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>Figure 5 shows that the identified quality categories are related to safety. In other words, there exist concepts that are present in more than one quality category, one of which is the safety quality category. All of the concepts extracted from the airworthiness standard belong to at least the safety quality category. In addition, some of those concepts also belong to categories other than the safety category. For example, a “shared resource” is a “concurrency” concept because multiple flows of control may be competing for access to it. This will also impact the performance aspects of the software. Moreover, it is also relevant to the “design” aspects of the software because the way it will be used is a result of design decisions. Finally, all of these aspects might impact the “safety”-aspects if one<br/>or more of the competing flows of control are executing a safety-critical software section.</p><p class="s30">Purely</p><p class="s30">Reliability</p><p class="s31">Primarily</p><p class="s31">Reliability</p><p class="s30">Purely</p><p class="s30">Integrity</p><p class="s31">Primarily</p><p class="s31">Integrity</p><p class="s30">Purely</p><p class="s30">Performance</p><p class="s31">Primarily</p><p class="s31">Performance</p><p class="s30">Purely</p><p class="s30">Concurrency</p><p class="s31">Primarily</p><p class="s31">Concurrency</p><p class="s31">Primarily Safety</p><p class="s31">Primarily</p><p class="s31">Certification</p><p class="s30">Purely</p><p class="s30">Certification</p><p class="s31">Primarily</p><p class="s31">Design</p><p class="s30">Purely</p><p class="s30">Design</p><p class="s31">Primarily</p><p class="s31">Configuration</p><p class="s30">Purely</p><p class="s30">Configuration</p><p class="s31">Safety-Related Concepts</p><p class="s32">(concepts of interest)</p><p><span><IMG width="441" height="192" src="A UML Profile for Developing Airworthiness-Compliant (RTCA DO-178B), Safety-Critical Software/Image_017.png"/></span></p><h4>Figure 5: Relationship between safety and other safety-related quality categories assuming that those categories form mutually exclusive sets.</h4><p>Regardless of its category, each concept can be one of three different kinds:<br/>1.   It can be a “safety entity”, which is software that may contribute, positively or negatively, to the overall safety level of the system or software. Furthermore, a safety entity can interact with another safety entity. An example of a safety entity would be identifying a particular software component as a fault monitor. A fault monitor (one safety entity) is used to monitor particular functions (other safety entities)  to  detect  faults  that  could  occur  and  cause  the  system  to  enter  a hazardous state. If a fault monitor detects such a fault,  it could then perform appropriate  actions  to  prevent  the  system  from   entering  hazardous  states.<br/>40</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>Therefore, the fault monitor is a safety entity whose purpose is to increase the overall level of safety of the system.<br/>2.   It can be a “safety attribute”, which is a concept that describes a safety property, such as the safety level or impact on safety, of safety entities. For example, the fault monitor described above may be used to detect specific  faults or unusual results and behaviours. For example, what if a particular software function that is used to indicate the altitude of the aircraft provides  output that says that the aircraft has a negative altitude? This is clearly an incorrect result. Assume that a fault resulting in this scenario is detectable by the fault monitor described earlier. In this case, this specific fault can be used as  a  safety attribute of the fault monitor. In other words, the complete  specification of the fault monitor safety entity will explicitly state through one of its safety attributes that it can detect this fault.<br/>3.   It can be a “safety method”, which is an activity, technique, or a process that may measure or impact, positively or negatively, the safety level of safety entities. For example, a scenario that describes the fault monitoring example  above covers many concepts such as fault monitoring, faults, and possibly many others that are related to the ability of monitoring software against faults that they may cause. Therefore,  all  that  discussion  is  centred  around  one  concept,  namely  “fault monitoring”.  Thus,  that  scenario  describes  one  “safety  method”  that  is  fault monitoring.<br/>The use of the word “safety” in safety entity, safety attribute, and safety method only means that those concepts are safety-related. It does not assume that they increase the level of safety.<br/>Figure 6 (a) formalises those definitions through a conceptual conceptual model. Notice that each safety entity is described through safety attributes. Safety entities may interact with each other, and they may implement safety methods (usually those that positively impact safety). Safety methods may measure or impact, positively or negatively, the<br/>41</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>safety  level  of  safety  entities.

They  are described  according  to  the  context  in  which  they  appear  within  the  airworthiness standard, RTCA DO-178B [4]. Those concepts are then refined into a terminology that is more suitable for modeling software. The refined concepts, along with their descriptions and their inter-concept relationships, are presented in section 3.2.</p><h3>3.2   Concept Refinement</h3><p>Section  3.1  and  Appendix  C  introduced  65  safety-related  concepts  that  were  found relevant  for  developing  airworthiness-compliant  software.  They  were  then  grouped according to their software quality category. In this section, those concepts are refined for the following reasons:<br/>1.   <i>Removing duplicate concepts: </i>In some instances, seemingly different  concepts appeared in the airworthiness standard where, in reality, they can be represented using a single concept or term. This is because the same  fundamental software concept  can  appear  in  different  forms  in   airworthiness-related  applications. Examples are presented below.<br/>Consider, for example, the two following primarily reliability concepts exactly as<br/>they appear in the airworthiness standard: <i>Multiple-Version Dissimilar Software</i><br/>42</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>and  <i>Software  Redundancy  </i>(see  Appendix  C.2  for  definitions).  They  revolve around  the  same  software  concept,  which  is  that  of  using  multiple  software components that have the same functionality but different implementations. It would be unnecessarily confusing to use two different terms to denote the same concept. As a result, a single refined term is provided to model both of those concepts, which  is  the  “replicated”  concept  to  denote  software  replication  or redundancy.<br/>2.   <i>Grouping  concepts:  </i>Some  concepts  are  in  fact  examples  of  a  more  general concept.<br/>Consider   the   following   concepts:   <i>Safety   Monitoring</i>,   <i>Loadable   Software Indicator</i>,  <i>Safeguard</i>,  <i>Safety  Feature  </i>(primarily  safety  concepts  defined  in Appendix C.1); <i>Error Detection</i>, <i>Fault Detection</i>, <i>Fault Containment </i>(primarily reliability concepts defined in Appendix C.2); <i>Integrity Check</i>, <i>Software Protector </i>(primary   integrity   concepts   defined   in   Appendix   C.3);   <i>Error   Prevention </i>(primarily design concept defined in Appendix C.7). They are applications of a single software-concept that is “Monitor”. A “monitor” monitors the activity of other software components to detect unusual, potentially hazardous, events.<br/>3.   <i>Precise definition of details: </i>Presenting each concept is a single entry in a list may be misleading by giving the impression that it is the smallest level of detail. In reality, each concept has many attributes that describe it, with each  attribute describing a single aspect of the concept. Examples are presented below.<br/>For example, “Safety Requirement” is identified as a (primarily safety) safety- related concept (Appendix C.1). However, it does not mention the specification of safety requirements. When refining the “Safety Requirement” concept, we give it an attribute called “specification” that can be used to specify the details of the requirement. Therefore, a concept’s attribute is used to describe a specific aspect or detail of it.<br/>The  rest  of  this  section  shows  how  the  concepts  and  their  relationships  have  been formalized under the form of a conceptual model, i.e., a UML class diagram (section<br/>43</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>3.2.1), describes the template we use to specify the concepts (section 3.2.2), and then actually specifies the concepts (section 3.2.3). Appendix D provides additional details on the relationships between concepts.</p><h4>3.2.1    Conceptual Model</h4><p>Before describing the details of the concepts, we introduce a conceptual model to list the refined concepts and formalize the relationships among them (Figure 7—its elements are further described in section 3.2.3). Thus, the motivations for defining a conceptual model for the refined concepts are:<br/>1.   It introduces a high-level presentation of the concepts and their relationships, thus leaving out most attributes that are considered low-level details. This  helps  the reader better understand the concepts and their relationships.<br/>2.   It formalises the relationships across the concepts, for instance by  specifying multiplicities on relationships.<br/>3.   It makes the definition and the use of the UML profile’s extensions (stereotypes, tagged values, and constraints) in section 5 easier because the refined concepts are designed to be more appropriate from a modeling point of view. Thus, many of the profile’s extensions refer back to the refined concepts. In  fact, the profile’s stereotypes and tagged values are based on the refined concepts, their attributes, and their relationships.</p><h4>3.2.2    Concept Details</h4><p>In this section, we describe the template we use in section 3.2.3 to define the concepts in<br/>Figure 7.

Its key advantages are in separating safety-critical design elements that have different safety levels, so that the failure of the less critical entity does not result in the failure of the more critical entities.</p><p class="s18">Attributes:</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse"><tr><td><p class="s24">Name</p></td><td><p class="s24">Description</p></td><td><p class="s24">Examples</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s25">Explanation</p></td><td><p class="s25">Provides    further    details    on    the reasons for the partitioning</p></td><td><p class="s25">“Partitioned away from a software component with a    higher    airworthiness level”, … etc</p></td></tr></table><p>57</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p class="s18">Relationships:</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse"><tr><td><p class="s24">Name</p></td><td><p class="s24">Description</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s25">References</p></td><td><p class="s25">Identifies  zero  or  more  “Requirement” (3.2.3.1)  instances  that specify the reasons for the “Partition” instance’s existence</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s25">Is Partitioned From</p></td><td><p class="s25">Identifies one or more “Safety Critical” (3.2.3.10) instances from which this “Partition” instance was partitioned</p></td></tr></table><p class="s18">Original Safety-Related Concepts:</p><p>Partitioning<br/>3.2.3.12     Handler</p><p class="s18">Definiton:</p><p>The “Handler” concept identifies a design element that handles events (3.2.3.8) that are detected by a monitor (3.2.3.13).

Then,  software  design  elements  can  be  traced  to  software  requirements  using  the “Rationale” (3.2.3.7) concept. There also exists other concepts that allow for specialized forms of traceability to requirements, namely the “Deviation” (3.2.3.2), Nature (3.2.3.6), Partition  (3.2.3.11),  Implementation  Style  (3.2.3.4),  and  Behavioural  Style  (3.2.3.5) concepts.<br/>In  addition,  the  conceptual  model  explicitly  identifies  the  “Event”  (3.2.3.8)  and<br/>“Reaction”  (3.2.3.9)  concepts,  and  establishes  traceability  links  between  those  two<br/>71</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>concepts and the “Handler” concept (3.2.3.12). Furthermore, it requires reactions to be traceable to events through the “Is Consequence Of” relationship.<br/>It is important to note that, while the traceability described above and in section 2.5 are commonly needed for developing software, this conceptual model satisfy many more traceability requirements than those. In fact, the “Rationale” (3.2.3.7) concept is a “one- size-fits-all” traceability concept that can be used to trace any model element to any other model element or requirement. For example, the “Rationale” (3.2.3.7) concept allows traceability links from safety-critical design elements to requirements, from subsystems to requirements, and from classes to subsystems</p><h3>3.3   Information Requirements</h3><p>Section 3.1 identified detailed safety-related concepts as they appear in the airworthiness standard, which were refined in section 3.2. Therefore, a UML profile useful for safety purposes should be able to model at least this information. In other words, the refined concepts are central to defining information requirements for the definition of a UML profile, and one can transform every concept into an information requirement.<br/>However, the information requirements we present below are defined at a level lower than the refined concept and, therefore, a refined concept may correspond to more than one information requirements. This is done so in order to break down concepts that capture many details and recognize the fact that existing profiles may only satisfy parts of a concept. For example, the “Reaction” concept and its “Consequence Of” attribute can be considered a single concept, but they capture two different pieces of information. Therefore, they are represented as two different information requirements (IREQ 22 and IREQ 23 below) to recognize the fact that a UML profile can meet only one of those two requirements (and therefore partially, but not entirely, be able to model the concept).<br/>Moreover, there are terms that are useful from a modeling prespective but that are not really safety-related concepts. They were not mentioned in section 3.2 because they are not concepts. Nevertheless, they help the modeler specify safety-related information in the model. Their information requirements are IREQ 1 - IREQ 8 (see below).

This explains how the original-high level requirements are met by a UML profile meeting the information requirements. If a “Yes” exists in a particular cell, this means that the information requirement identified by its row traces back to the high-level requirement identified by its column. Each information requirement may trace back to more than one high-level requirement. As the table illustrates, there is an n-to-n relationship between high-level requirements and information requirements.<br/>The requirements traceability matrix answers the following question: Which information requirements (IREQ) are required in order to meet a particular high-level requirement (REQ)? Conversly, it can also be used to answer the following question: For a particular information  requirement  (IREQ),  which  high-level  requirements  (REQ)  does  it  help meet? Therefore, it is useful if the reader is interested in knowing additional details about how  a  particular  profile  meets  the  original  requirements  (REQ).  Therefore,  all  the information requirements trace to both the safety-related concepts, which form the basis for the information requirements, and are justified by the high-level requirements.<br/>76</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>The rest of this document focuses on the information requirements (IREQ) rather than the high-level requirements (REQ) because they are easier to use for assessing UML profiles.

existing UML profiles and approaches and evaluates each one of them  with  respect  to  the  information  requirements  identified  in  section 3.3.  This  is required to determine whether a suitable profile already exists or not, which would determine whether an existing profile should be extended (if necessary) or a completely new profile should be defined. Details of the evaluations are reported in Appendix F and summarized in the following sections.</p><h3>4.1   Quality of Service and Fault Tolerance OMG Profile</h3><p>OMG released a profile to model Quality of Service (QoS) for high-quality and Fault- Tolerant (FT) systems. The profile, presented in [5], includes frameworks to describe quality of service, risk assessment, and fault tolerance.<br/>The framework to describe quality of service includes mechanisms to describe generic quality of service driven from quality-based requirements. It is not specific to any kind of quality of service, such as safety. Its mechanisms focus on characteristics, constraints, and levels of quality of service. The risk assessment framework includes support for model-based  risk  assessment.  It  provides  mechanisms  for  modeling  risk  contexts, stakeholders, assets, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, unwanted incidents, risk quantification, and risk mitigation and treatments. The fault tolerance framework includes mechanisms for describing fault-tolerant software architectures in general as a technical   solution   to   reliability   requirements.   It   focuses   on   modeling   software redundancy, or software replication.<br/>Table 18 in Appendix F presents an analysis of the profile with respect to each of the information requirements described in section 3.3. The table concludes that this profile is not adequate for extension to meet the information requirements since only 17 of the information requirements (out of 54) are fulfilled.<br/>79</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><h3>4.2   Schedulability, Performance, and Time OMG Profile</h3><p>OMG released a profile, the Schedulability, Performance, and Time (SPT) profile, which provides mechanisms to model concepts of importance to real-time systems. Real-time systems are those where there exist timing requirements on when the responses to events occur. Soft real-time systems are those were late responses may be acceptable if they are not  within  a  specified  range,  whereas  hard  real-time  systems  are  those  where  late responses are unacceptable and may be fatal [6]. The profile, presented in [6], includes frameworks  to  model  resources,  time,  concurrency,  schedulability,  performance,  and CORBA schedulability properties. Using it allows developers to perform performance analysis of the model.<br/>The resource modeling framework includes mechanisms to model resources, components that  acquire  and  release  them,  and  their  deployment  on  hosts.  The  time  modeling framework includes mechanisms to model clocks, timers, timeouts, and actions that are applied on them such as delays, interrupts, events, pause, reset, start, and stop. The concurrency  modeling  framework  includes  mechanisms  to  model  synchronous  and asynchronous actions, and event queues for immediate and deferred event processing. The schedulability analysis framework includes mechanism to model actions, engines, responses, scheduling resources, triggers, action schedulers, and scheduling hosts. The performance analysis framework includes mechanism to model performance contexts, open and closed workloads, and steps. The CORBA schedulability framework includes mechanisms  to  model  CORBA  channels,  connections,  clients,  servers,  and  Object Resource Brokers (ORBs).<br/>Table 19 in Appendix F presents an analysis of the profile with respect to each of the information requirements described in section 3.3. The table concludes that this profile is not adequate for extension to meet the information requirements since only 6 of the information requirements (out of 54) are fulfilled. The profile does not meet many of the information requirements because it does not cover safety and reliabity topics.<br/>80</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><h3>4.3   HIDOORS Profile</h3><p>The High Integrity Distributed Object-Oriented Real-Time Systems (HIDOORS) was a joint research project by several European companies and research institutions. One of the goals of HIDOORS was to introduce mechanisms for modeling safety-critical and embedded real-time applications. Those mechanisms were required to be compliant with OMG’s  SPT  profile  (see  section  4.2),  provide  mechanisms  for  modeling  the  Rate Monotonic Analysis (RMA) scheduling strategy, and provide specific concepts relating to inter-task communication. The researchers involved in this project felt that UML’s SPT profile was too general and too fundamental to provide mechanisms for specifying RMA and some inter-task communication concepts [26]. The profile therefore specializes some   SPT   concepts   such   as   triggers,   actions,   resources,   and   scheduling   jobs. Furthermore, it provides mechanisms to model inter-task communication styles such as buffers, black boards, and events.<br/>Table 20 in Appendix F presents an analysis of the profile with respect to each of the information requirements described in section 3.3. The table concludes that this profile is not adequate for extension to meet the information requirements since only 6 of the information  requirements  (out  of  54)  are  fulfilled.  The  profile  included  only  few stereotypes so it does not meet most of the information requirements. In fact, it did not meet any information requirements that were not already met by the SPT profile.</p><h3>4.4   Effects of Message Loss, Delay, and Corruption</h3><p>Jan Jürjens presented a UML profile in [27] that aimes at addressing safety issues from a fault-tolerant  point  of  view.  Jürjens  argued  that  safety  goals  are  often  expressed quantitatively via the maximum failure rate, and then presented some possible failures that served as the basis of the proposed UML profile. Thus, his profile assumes that those failures are based on the concept of transmitting messages on <i>links </i>and between <i>nodes</i>. The profile included mechanisms to model risks, crashes, guarantees, redundancy, safe links, safe dependencies, safety critical elements, safe behaviours, containment, and error handling.<br/>81</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>Table 21 in Appendix F presents an analysis of the profile with respect to each of the information requirements described in section 3.3. The table concludes that this profile is not adequate for extension to meet the information requirements since only 7 of the information requirements (out of 54) are fulfilled. In fact, it does not meet many of the information requirements because assuming the airworthiness standard does not make the assumption that unsafe states result from failures of transmitting messages because safety is a bigger issue than that.</p><h3>4.5   Patterns for Reliability and Safety</h3><p>Hansen and Gullesen presented in [28] a series of UML patterns that can be used to model some aspects of safety-critical systems. They presented patterns for modeling safety quality of service, software diversity and voting, partial diversity with built-in diagnostic or monitoring, “safe” communication protocols, and some other topics such as testing, hazard analysis and quality development. Their work was driven by the IEC<br/>61508 standard in [24]. They have therefore used the concept of Safety Integrity Level (SIL), which is similar to the concept of software level presented in the airworthiness standard [4]. The patterns include mechanisms to model the SIL levels, and other patterns that could be used to explicitly model, in use cases, redundancy, monitoring, and voting based on multiple output comparisons.<br/>Table 22 in Appendix F presents an analysis of the profile with respect to each of the information requirements described in section 3.3. The table concludes that the patterns presented  in  this  paper  are  not  adequate  for  extension  to  meet  the  information requirements since only 1 of the information requirements (out of 54) are fulfilled. The patterns  mostly  focus  on  reliability  and  software  replication  issues,  whereas  the information requirements cover a bigger concern.</p><h3>4.6   Summary</h3><p>Table 23 in Appendix F summarizes how each of those existing UML profiles scores with respect to addressing the information requirements identified in section 3.3. Each<br/>82</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>profile’s  score  is  calculated  based  on  how  many  information  requirements  it  meets. Therefore, the maximum score is 54 (100%).<br/>As it can be noticed from previous sections, which results are summarized in Table 23, none  of  the  existing  profiles  that  were  evaluated  achieves  more  than  31%  of  the maximum score. In fact, all of the profiles combined only meet 44% of the information requirements.<br/>The two OMG profiles are useful, but only within their intended domain. The OMG QoS and FT profile is suitable for modeling fault tolerance and software redundancy. The OMG SPT profile is suitable for modeling schedulability, performance, and concurrency concepts.  However,  it  was  evident  in  section  3  that  safety  and  airworthiness  are dependent   on   many   domains.   Therefore,   those   two   OMG   profiles   would   be complimentary, but not complete enough. It should also be noticed that the SPT profile included more details than the QoS and FT profile, but it was centred on domains that are somehow  less  important  to  safety  (resources,  time,  concurrency,  performance,  and schedulability) than those covered by the QoS and FT profile (quality of service, risk assessment, fault tolerance).<br/>Furthermore, the profile for the “effects of messages on safety” introduces some useful stereotypes      such      as      &lt;&lt;safe      behaviour&gt;&gt;,      &lt;&lt;guarantee&gt;&gt;,      &lt;&lt;critical&gt;&gt;,<br/>&lt;&lt;containment&gt;&gt;and &lt;&lt;redundancy&gt;&gt;. However, some of them are too general to be effective,  such  as  &lt;&lt;critical&gt;&gt;  which  does  not  tell  us  the  criticality  level  (e.g. airworthiness level) of the software. Neverthless, it meets some information requirements that are not met by the 2 OMG profiles such as the ability to model exception handlers.<br/>The  “HIDOORS”  profile  did  not  meet  any  information  requirements  that  were  not already met by the SPT profile.<br/>The “Patterns” paper did not fulfil any information requirements that were not fulfilled by the other profiles.<br/>Because none of the existing UML profiles and patterns comes close to fulfilling the information  requirements,  a  new  UML  profile  is  proposed  instead  of  extending  an<br/>83</p><p class="s40">Carleton UniversityTR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                               Decermber  2006</p><p class="s41">existing   one.  <span class="s42">Th</span>is   has  the  advantage   that  the  resultant  profile   will  be  coherent  and speclcally  designed   to  meet  the  information  requirements  instead   of  &quot;patching&quot; an existing  profile that was originally designed  for some other purpose</p><p class="s41">84</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><h2>5   PROPOSED UML PROFILE</h2><p>Since no suitable UML profile was found, this section introduces a new UML profile that meets all of the information requirements. Section 5.1 describes the template we use to describe the profile whereas section 5.2 describes the profile proper. Examples are then presented in section 5.3 to explain in detail how to use this proposed UML profile. Section 5.4 suggests a methodology to be followed when using the profile.</p><h3>5.1   UML Profile—Template Description</h3><p>This section introduces a UML profile that satisfies all of the information requirements specified in section 3.3. The discussion on how this proposed profile meets all of the information requirements is presented in section 8.1.<br/>Each of the subsections of section 5.2 describes a single stereotype and associated tagged values. Most of the stereotypes correspond to some refined concepts. However, some additional stereotypes, which do not correspond to any refined concepts, were deemed helpful for modeling purposes are introduced. The stereotypes’ tagged values correspond to  the  refined  concepts’  attributes  and  relationships.  The  following  information  is presented for each stereotype:<br/>1.   <i>Definition: </i>This presents a definition for the stereotype. It describes the stereotype and gives its general purpose.<br/>2.   <i>Related Concept: </i>This identifies, if applicable, the concept from section 3.2.2 that the stereotype represents.<br/>3.   <i>Base Classes: </i>This lists the UML meta-classes on which the stereotype may be applied. The explanation on how and why the stereotype may be applied on each meta-class is also presented. This does not identify meta-classes on  which  the stereotype may not be applied to allow future extenstions of this  profile to be backwards  compatible.  This  is  because  future  extension  may   permit  the application of the stereotypes on meta-classes that are not explicit  here. This is<br/>85</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>necessary because extending UML, such as in the form of UML profiles, permits adding new rules but does not allow removing existing rules.<br/>4.   <i>Tags:  </i>This  lists  the  tags  that  the  stereotype  has.  For  each  tag,  the   type, multiplicity, and a description is presented.<br/>The base classes of each stereotype are presented in a table. For example, the base classes of the &lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; (5.2.17) stereotype are presented as follows:</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse"><tr><td><p class="s24">Base Class</p></td><td><p class="s24">Usage Rationale</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s25">Class</p></td><td><p class="s25">To indicate that the class is safety-critical (3.2.3.10) and specify its safety (e.g. airworthiness) level</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s25">Operation</p></td><td><p class="s25">To indicate that invoking the operation is safety-critical (3.2.3.10)</p><p class="s25">and specify its safety (e.g. airworthiness) level</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s25">Relationship</p></td><td><p class="s25">To indicate that the relationship is safety-critical (3.2.3.10) and specify its safety (e.g. airworthiness) level</p></td></tr></table><p>The first column lists the UML meta-classes on whose instances the stereotype can be applied. The UML classes are specified as defined in the UML meta-model in [29] and [30]. This profile uses only the following base classes in the first column:<br/>1.   <i>Collaboration:         </i>Used         to         represent         instances         of         class<br/>“CompositeStructures::Collaborations::Collaboration”.<br/>2.   <i>Class:   </i>Used   to   represent   instances   of   class   “Kernel::Class”   and   class<br/>“BasicComponents::Component”.<br/>3.   <i>Operation: </i>Used to represent instances of class “Kernel::Operation”.<br/>4.   <i>Relationship: </i>Used to represent instances of class “Kernel::Relationship”. The second column describes why the stereotype can be applied on each base class.<br/>Thus, the above table is read as follows: The &lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; stereotype can be<br/>applied on all UML model classes that are instances of the following meta-classes (first<br/>86</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>column): Class, Operation, and Relationship. It is applied on each of the base classes as follows (second column):<br/>1.   <i>Class: </i>To indicate that the class is safety-critical (3.2.3.10) and specify its safety<br/>(e.g. airworthiness) level<br/>2.   <i>Operation: </i>To indicate that invoking the operation is safety-critical (3.2.3.10) and specify its safety (e.g. airworthiness) level<br/>3.   <i>Relationship: </i>To indicate that the relationship is safety-critical (3.2.3.10)  and specify its safety (e.g. airworthiness) level<br/>The  tags  of  each  stereotype  are  presented  in  a  table.  For  example,  the  tags  of  the<br/>&lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; (5.2.17) stereotype are presented as follows:</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse"><tr><td><p class="s24">Name</p></td><td><p class="s24">Type</p></td><td><p class="s24">Multiplicity</p></td><td><p class="s24">Description</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s25">CriticalityLevel</p></td><td><p class="s25">Enumeration</p></td><td><p class="s25">[0..1]</p></td><td><p class="s25">See attribute: Criticality Level</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s25">ConfidenceLevel</p></td><td><p class="s25">Enumeration</p></td><td><p class="s25">[0..1]</p></td><td><p class="s25">See     attribute:     Confidence</p><p class="s25">Level</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s25">TriggeredEvent</p></td><td><p class="s25">Reference   to   a model     element stereotyped</p><p class="s25">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt; (5.2.15)   (or   its subclass</p><p class="s25">&lt;&lt;Reaction&gt;&gt; (5.2.16))</p></td><td><p class="s25">[0..*]</p></td><td><p class="s25">See relationship: Triggers</p></td></tr></table><p>The first column specifies the tag name, the second column specifies the type of the tag, the third column specifies its multiplicity, and the fourth column provides a description of the  tag.  In  most  cases, the  fourth column  will  refer  the reader  to  an  attribute or  a relationship of the related concept.<br/>This example tells us that this stereotype has the following tags and they are described as follows:<br/>87</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>1.   The “CriticalityLevel” tag (first column) of the &lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; stereotype is specified through an enumeration (second column). It can be specified zero or one time  (third  column)  for  each  stereotype.  Its  description  is  the  same  as  the “Criticality Level” attribute of the related concept  (“Safety  Critical” (3.2.3.10) concept in this case) (fourth column).<br/>2.   The “ConfidenceLevel” tag (first column) of the &lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; stereotype is specified through an enumeration (second column). It can be specified zero or one time  (third  column)  for  each  stereotype.  Its  description  is  the  same  as  the “Confidence Level” attribute of the related concept (“Safety Critical” (3.2.3.10) concept in this case) (fourth column).<br/>3.   The “TriggeredEvent” tag (first column) of the &lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; stereotype is specified through a reference to a model element stereotyped with &lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt; or<br/>&lt;&lt;Reaction&gt;&gt; (second column). It can be specified zero or as many times as one wishes (third column) for each stereotype. Its description is the same as the “Triggers” relationship of the related concept (“SafetyCritical” (3.2.3.10) concept in this case) (fourth column).</p><h3>5.2   Profile Description</h3><h4>5.2.1    &lt;&lt;SafetyContext&gt;&gt;</h4><p class="s18">Definiton:</p><p>The &lt;&lt;SafetyContext&gt;&gt; stereotype is used to indicate that there is safety-related information  of  interest  such  as  information  representing  the  original  primarily safety concepts listed in Appendix C.1.</p><p class="s18">Related Concept:</p><p>None<br/>88</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p class="s18">Base Classes:</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse"><tr><td><p class="s24">Base Class</p></td><td><p class="s24">Usage Rationale</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s25">Collaboration</p></td><td><p class="s25">To indicate that the collaboration contains safety information</p></td></tr></table><p class="s18">Tags:</p><p>None</p><h4>5.2.2    &lt;&lt;ReliabilityContext&gt;&gt;</h4><p class="s18">Definiton:</p><p>The &lt;&lt;ReliabilityContext&gt;&gt; stereotype is used to indicate that there is reliability- related  information  of  interest  such  as  information  representing  the  original primarily reliability concepts listed in Appendix C.2.

The examples are explained in detail, and they serve to help the reader better understand the UML profile and how it can be used.This thesis discusses a total of nine examples (plus a case study in section 7). Three of those examples are discussed below as they primarily use concepts (and stereotypes) that are key to the airworthiness standard (e.g., the notion of software level) or that are not supported by other UML profiles. The reminaing six examples are discussed in . Appendix G. The examples are also stereotyped according to Gomaa’s class classification as presented in [7] and summarized in Appendix E.</p><h4>5.3.1    Hardware/Software Interfaces</h4><p>The example in Figure 8 shows a Kalman filter and how it connects to the radar that provides its input and a simulator of the outside world’s events.<br/>115</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>Kalman filters are recursive functions. Therefore, <span class="s43">KalmanFilter </span>is stereotyped with<br/>&lt;&lt;ImplementationStyle&gt;&gt; (5.2.11) whose “Kind” tagged value is set to “Recursive”.<br/>The project in which this system is developed has a coding standard requirement that says that “recursive algorithms shall not be used”. Therefore the <span class="s43">KalmanFilter </span>class is also a deviation, or a violation, of the coding standard requirement, and is stereotyped with<br/>&lt;&lt;Deviation&gt;&gt;      (5.2.10)      whose      “Kind”      tagged      value      is      set      to “UsingRecursiveAlgorithm”. The “Reference” tagged value is set to “CodingStandard” to indicate that using recursive algorithms is a deviation from, or a violation of, the project’s coding standard.<br/>Furthermore,  filters  are  time-related  functions.  Therefore,  <span class="s43">KalmanFilter </span>is  also stereotyped with &lt;&lt;BehaviouralStyle&gt;&gt; (5.2.12) whose “Kind” tagged value is set to “Time-Related”.<br/>Now,  Kalman  filters  process  radar  outputs.  Since  this  example  has  a  software implementation for the Kalman filter, it has to interface with the actual radar hardware on the aircraft. For this reason, <span class="s43">RadarInterface </span>is available to provide an interface between the software Kalman filter and the hardware radar device. Thus, <span class="s43">RadarInterface </span>is stereotyped  with  &lt;&lt;Interface&gt;&gt;  (5.2.25)  whose  “IsBetweenHardwareAndSoftware” tagged   value   is   set   to   “true”.   The   “InterfaceFor”   tagged   value   indicates   that <span class="s43">RadarInterface </span>is an interface for the actual radar hardware.<br/>The testing of such systems is often performed in system integration labs. In other words, the software is not loaded on the aircraft and the aircraft flown just to perform software unit or integration testing. That would just be too expensive! Therefore, a software simulator is developed to simulate world events that happen outside of the aircraft. This simulator   is   <span class="s43">RealWorldEventSimulator </span>and   is   stereotyped   with   &lt;&lt;Simulator&gt;&gt; (5.2.21). The “SimulatedEntity” tagged value indicates that it simulates the input to <span class="s43">RadarInterface</span>. Furthermore, the “SimulationParameter” tagged value indicates that the inputs exhibit a stochastic Poisson process with an average inter-arrival time of 20 milliseconds.<br/>116</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>All the information described above is relevant for two purposes. First, it describes how software  was  designed  to  improve  the  development  process  -  this  was  achieved,  as described   above,   by   using   a   simulator   to   improve   the   testing   process   and   a hardware/software  interface  to  provide  communication  between  radar  hardware  and Kalman filter software. Simulators are often used to test systems [1]. Therefore, the whole diagram is stereotyped with &lt;&lt;DesignContext&gt;&gt; (5.2.7) to indicate that this design setup is of special interest. Secondly, the modeled classes contain information that is relevant for the software certification aspects. For example, the airworthiness standard specifies  that  the  certification  authorities  need  to  know  about  all  hardware/software interfaces and deviations from plans or standards. Therefore, the diagram is stereotyped with &lt;&lt;CertificationContext&gt;&gt; (5.2.6) to indicate that it contains information relevant for<br/>the certification of the software in this diagram.</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;algorithm&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;ImplementationStyle&gt;&gt; {Kind=Recursive}</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;Deviation&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">{Kind=UsingRecursiveAlgorithm</p><p class="s27">Reference=CodingStandard}</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;BehaviouralStye&gt;&gt; {Kind=Time-Related} KalmanFilter</p><p class="s27">1</p><p><span><IMG width="563" height="212" src="A UML Profile for Developing Airworthiness-Compliant (RTCA DO-178B), Safety-Critical Software/Image_023.png"/></span></p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;DesignContext&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;CertificationContext&gt;&gt;                               &lt;&lt;algorithm&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;Simulator&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">{SimulatedEntity=“RadarInput”, SimulatorParameter=(Poisson, Lamba=20ms)}</p><p class="s27">RealWorldEventSimulator</p><p class="s27">1</p><p class="s27">Reads Simulator Outputs   1</p><p class="s27">Reads Radar Outputs</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;input device interface&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">1                         &lt;&lt;Interface&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">{IsBetweenHardwareAndSoftware=true</p><p class="s27">InterfaceFor=RadarHardware}</p><p class="s27">RadarInterface</p><h4>Figure 8: Kalman filter processing input, through an interface, from a simulator</h4><h4>(structure).</h4><h4>5.3.2    Contributions to Failure Conditions</h4><p>The example Figure 9 shows software that controls the landing wheels of the aircraft.</p><p class="s43">PilotKeyboardInterface <span class="p">is an interface to the keyboard used by the aircraft’s pilots to deploy or hide the landing wheels when desired. An aircraft normally has two pilots, so it is     likely     that     there     will     be     several     keyboards     that     can     command </span>LandingWheelsController <span class="p">to deploy or hide the landing wheels.</span></p><p>117</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p class="s43">LandingWheelsController <span class="p">communicates with the landing wheel hardware, through </span>LandingWheelsInterface<span class="p">,  and  can  command  it  to  hide  or  deploy  the  wheels.  The wheels  are  deployed  when  the  aircraft  is  on  the  ground  or  about  to  land.  Since </span>LandingWheelsInterface <span class="p">is  an  interface  for  the  landing  wheel  hardware,  it  is stereotyped with &lt;&lt;Interface&gt;&gt; (5.2.25), its “IsBetweenHardwareAndSoftware” tagged value is set to “true”, and its “InterfaceFor” tagged value is set to “LandingWheels”.</span></p><p class="s43">LandingWheelsController <span class="p">is a safety-critical element as well because it must ensure that the landing wheels are deployed when the aircraft is on the ground or it is at a low altitude because it is landing. If the landing wheels are not deployed when the aircraft is on  the  ground  or  is  landing,  then  this  could  result  in  fatal  injuries  to  the  aircraft occupants. In the context of airworthiness, such software is assigned is assigned level B. Therefore, </span>LandingWheelsController <span class="p">is stereotyped with &lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; (5.2.17) and its “CriticalityLevel” tagged value is set to “B”. This is also why this diagram was stereotyped      with      &lt;&lt;SafetyContext&gt;&gt;      (5.2.1).      Because      it      depends      on </span>LandingWheelsInterface<span class="p">,         the         airworthiness         rules         specify         that </span>LandingWheelsInterface <span class="p">must also be safety-critical and have a software level equal to at   least   the   highest   level   of   all   classes   that   depend   on   it.   In   this   example, </span>LandingWheelsInterface <span class="p">is  stereotyped  with  &lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt;  (5.2.17)  and  is assigned “CriticalityLevel” equal to that of </span>LandingWheelsController<span class="p">, namely level “B”.</span></p><p>To ensure a higher level of safety, <span class="s43">LandingWheelsController </span>implements defensive programming mechanisms by ensuring that the pilot does not attempt to hide the landing wheels when they shouldn’t. Defensive programming is common when developing user interfaces.  In  this  example,  <span class="s43">LandingWheelsController </span>defends  against  the  pilot’s attempt to hide the landing wheels when the aircraft’s altitude is less than 100 meters by keeping  the  landing  wheels  deployed.  This  is  explicitly  specified  by  stereotyping <span class="s43">LandingWheelsController </span>with the &lt;&lt;Defensive&gt;&gt; (5.2.27) stereotype and specifying its “DefendableInput” and “Reaction” tagged values. (The KeepWheelsDeployed model element stereotyped &lt;&lt;Reaction&gt;&gt; is not shown in the diagram: It would be an operation of the LandingWheelsInterface class.)<br/>118</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p class="s43">LandingWheelsController <span class="p">determines the aircraft’s altitude by reading the radar output from  </span>RadarInterface<span class="p">.  </span>RadarInterface <span class="p">was  explained  in  detail  in  section  5.3.1. However, it has also been stereotyped here with &lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; (5.2.17) to explicitly specify      the      fact      that      some      safety-critical      functionality,      such      as </span>LandingWheelsController<span class="p">, depends on it. Moreover, it has also been stereotyped with</span></p><p>&lt;&lt;Complexity&gt;&gt; (5.2.24) and its “Measure” and “Value” tagged values indicate that the<br/>implementation must not have a “Big-O” larger than “n<span class="s14">2”  </span>(where the meaning of “n” is dependent  on  the  algorithm  in  context).  This  is  because  radars  usually  have  high frequency inputs, so the code of the corresponding interfaces must be optimized.<br/>Furthermore,      <span class="s43">RadarInterface   </span>is      monitored      by      <span class="s43">RadarDataValidator</span>. <span class="s43">RadarDataValidator </span>is a monitor whose purpose is to ensure that <span class="s43">RadarInterface </span>produces high-integrity information (i.e. high precision and accuracy). This is specified through the &lt;&lt;Monitor&gt;&gt; (5.2.20) stereotype that is applied on <span class="s43">RadarDataValidator</span>. Because the purpose of <span class="s43">RadarValidatorDataValidator </span>is to ensure the integrity of the data, its “Kind” tagged value is set to “Integrity”. Furthermore, the “MonitoredEntity” tagged value explicitly identifies the class that is monitored, namely <span class="s43">RadarInterface</span>. This is also why this diagram was stereotyped &lt;&lt;IntegrityContext&gt;&gt; (5.2.3).<br/>Finally, this diagram was also stereotyped with &lt;&lt;ReliabilityContext&gt;&gt; (5.2.2) because it is crucial that the modeled classes be reliable to the requirements. For example, the requirements     specified     by     the     &lt;&lt;Defensive&gt;&gt;     (5.2.27)     stereotype     on <span class="s43">LandingWheelsController </span>must be correctly implemented (e.g. it must not allow hiding<br/>the wheels for altitudes less than 100 meters, and not greater than 100 meters!).<br/>119</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;input device interface&gt;&gt; PilotKeyboardInterface</p><p class="s27">*</p><p><span><IMG width="568" height="367" src="A UML Profile for Developing Airworthiness-Compliant (RTCA DO-178B), Safety-Critical Software/Image_024.png"/></span></p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;SafetyContext&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;ReliabilityContext&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;IntegrityContext&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;algorithm&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;Monitor&gt;&gt; {Kind=Integrity</p><p class="s27">MonitoredEntity=RadarInterface} RadarDataValidator</p><p class="s27">Commands</p><p class="s27">1</p><p class="s27">Monitors      1</p><p class="s27">1</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;state dependent control&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; {CriticalityLevel=B}</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;Defensive&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">{DefendableInput=</p><p class="s27">‘Altitude &lt; 100 m &amp;&amp; Command=“HideWheels”’ Reaction=KeepWheelsDeployed}</p><p class="s27">LandingWheelsController</p><p class="s27">1</p><p class="s27">1  Reads Radar Outputs  1</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;input device interface&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; {CriticalityLevel=B}</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;Complexity&gt;&gt; {Measure=Big-O, Value=“n<span class="s28">2</span>”}, ComplexityOf=RadarInterface}</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;Interface&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">{IsBetweenHardwareAndSoftware=true</p><p class="s27">InterfaceFor=RadarHardware} RadarInterface</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;output device interface&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;Interface&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">Commands</p><p class="s27">1           {IsBetweenHardwareAndSoftware=true</p><p class="s27">InterfaceFor=LandingWheels}</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; {CriticalityLevel=B} LandingWheelsInterface</p><h4>Figure 9: Landing wheel controller processing user and radar inputs (structure).</h4><h4>5.3.3    Software Configurations</h4><p>The diagram in Figure 10 shows a configurable user interface. The user interface interacts with the users by displaying text in their language of preference. <span class="s43">UserInterface </span>itself is language-independent. It reads and displays textual strings in any of three languages: English, French, and German. This is achieved through <span class="s43">UserInterfaceDictionary</span>, which is stereotyped with &lt;&lt;Configurable&gt;&gt; (5.2.28) to indicate that the user can change its configuration. The “Kind” tagged value is set to “Lookup-Table” and the “When” tagged value is set to “Run-Time” to indicate that look-up tables can be loaded into it at run-time to change its configuration.

This section shows how a UML model using the proposed UML profile can be used to automatically generate information that can either be submitted to the certification authorities, or can be used to track issues of relevance to the certification authorities. In either case, this information improves communication   between   airworthiness   engineers   and   software   engineers.   The information required for submission to the certification authorities for each software level is listed in section 11 and annex A in the airworthiness standard, RTCA DO-178B [4].</p><h3>6.1   Technological Requirements</h3><p>In order to be able to generate certification information from UML models, there are technological  requirements  that  software  development  tools  must  support.  Those requirements can be summarized in one requirement, namely the ability to search UML models based on the stereotypes that are applied to model elements and the values of the stereotypes’ tagged values.<br/>For example, consider a scenario when one needs to identify all safety-critical model elements. In this case, the modeling tool must be able to search the UML model and identify all model elements, such as classes in class diagrams, that have been stereotyped with &lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; (5.2.17). If the user of the tool needs to identify all safety- critical model elements that are assigned software level A, for example, then the tool must  be  able  to  read  the  “CriticalityLevel”  tagged  value  of  the  &lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; (5.2.17) stereotype and identify when it is set to “A”. This is why the proposed UML profile emphasizes specifying information in machine-readable language.<br/>In practice, there are several possible methods to achieve this technological requirement of being able to search UML models. Below is a list of some methods to guide the users of the proposed UML profile.<br/>125</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><h4>6.1.1    Integrated Support in UML Modeling Tools</h4><p>One convenient method to extract safety information from UML models is to provide a mechanism to do so in the UML modeling tool itself. UML modeling tools already offer some sort of search capabilities for the designers. For example, ARTiSAN Studio [31], which  is  a  UML  modeling  tool  from  ARTiSAN  Software  Inc.,  allows  designers  to identify where specific model elements are used. That is one example of ARTiSAN’s search  capabilities.  Another  example  of  a  modeling  tool  is  International  Business Machines Corporation’s (IBM) Rational Software Architect [32]. A third example is Telelogic’s Rhapsody [33]. This UML model-driven development tool allows designers to search UML models for uses of specific stereotypes. In addition, it supports the Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) scripting language, which allows modelers to write their own scripts and execute them on models. This could be used to perform search queries.<br/>The  Eclipse  Modeling  Framework  (EMF)  for  Java  [34]  is  a  popular,  and  easily extensible, software development framework. Some of EMF’s extensions include the capability to use the Object Constraint Language (OCL) [35] to specify search queries on UML  models,  and  then  write  Java  code  to  execute  them.  Examples  of  the  search capabilities of this technology include the capability to search for all objects that are instances of a specific class. However, the current state of this technology does not support searching UML models based on the stereotypes applied to model elements and the values assigned to the tagged values. Nevertheless, the integration of EMF and OCL is a promising approach that should be easibly extensible to support search queries based on stereotypes and tagged values.</p><h4>6.1.2    Exporting UML Models using XMI</h4><p>XMI [36] is an OMG standard for representing, and therefore exchanging, models and metadata in an XML-based language.<br/>In practice, UML modeling tools can export UML models in the XMI language. This would create an XML file containing all the model data. Since XMI is a standard format, it can be imported by any other tool, thus establishing a common format across different<br/>126</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>tools. For example, imagine project A that is using Rational Software Architect to model its software. Further, assume that project A is similar in nature to a previously completed project B that used ARTiSAN Studio to model its software. Project A now wants to reuse the software model from project B. To achieve this, one would use a feature from ARTiSAN Studio that would export an XMI file containing all the software model for project B. Then, project A can import this XMI file using an import XMI file feature in Rational Software Architect. Thus, the model would be transfered from project B to project A.<br/>In our case of generating certification information, the model would be exported from the modeling tool by generating an XMI file. Once an XMI file containing the software model is available, it can be easily parsed and searched. This is possible in many ways, but  the  most  appropriate  method  would  probably  involve  the  use  of  the  Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) [37]. XSL is used to parse and transform XML-based files, such as XMI files, to any desired format. Such transformation is achieved by using XSL files called stylesheets. The purpose of XSL stylesheets is then to display the same model data in different formats or views, just like the Model-View-Controller (MVC) software pattern displays the same model information in different views. Using this approach, XSL stylesheets can be developed to execute search queries on the model data in the XMI files.</p><h3>6.2   Examples</h3><p>The examples presented below are specified in a high-level Structured Query Language (SQL)-like language. It is intended to be pseudocode-like, result in shorter text (see below), and be implementation-independent. Developers can also use them to implement using existing development tools and frameworks (refer to documentation of the existing tools  and  frameworks  for  more  detail).  It  does  not  require  the  reader  to  have  any knowledge of other tools or frameworks. The grammar for the language used is specified in an extension of the Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF), which is a popular syntax for specifiying languages [38]. The EBNF language itself is specified in the EBNF<br/>127</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>standard [39].

The goal is to demonstrate, through a realistic case study the usefulness of the profile in the context of the usage scenarios we defined (section 2.4). In order to be complete and provide enough insights about the system to the reader, we also go through the development methodology described in section 5.4.<br/>Here is a mapping between the steps of the development methodology (Figure 11 in section 5.4) and the subsections where they are addressed:<br/>S-1   <i>Define  the  system’s  high-level  functional  requirements:  </i>In  section  7.1,  an overview of the system is introduced, which describes in high-level  language the major functionalities of the system.<br/>S-2   <i>Define  the  system  architecture:  </i>The  system  architecture  is  presented  and explained in section 7.2.<br/>S-3   <i>Develop  the  detailed  functional  and  non-functional  requirements  (excluding safety): </i>The functional requirements of the subsystem under study are presented and explained in section 7.3.<br/>S-4   <i>Perform  a  safety  assessment  and  develop  safety  requirements:  </i>A   safety assessment is performed in section 7.4 using four standard,  complementary methods.

Fly-To-Point (FTP): An FTP specifies a location on earth that the aircraft plans to fly to. For example, an aircraft flying from London to Paris will have at least one FTP, which is Paris.<br/>2.   Latitude/Longitude   (LAT/LONG):   A   LAT/LONG   specifies   a    particular geographic position on earth in latitude and longitude. LAT/LONG values are the standard measures for specifying geographic positions in navigation systems. The unit of both LAT and LONG are degrees, with LAT ranging from 90 South to 90<br/>North, and Longitude ranging from 180 Westward to 180 Eastward. LAT/LONG<br/>values are generally used to specify FTP positions.<br/>3.   Bearing: The bearing on an aircraft is the direction in which it is flying.  The bearing is generally specified in degrees, with a range of [0, 360[. A bearing of<br/>135</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>zero is in a direction starting from the aircraft’s position and towards the North<br/>Pole.<br/>4.   Dead-Reckoning: Dead-reckoning an aircraft’s position means that the aircraft’s position is being approximated using a previously known position at a given point of time, the current speed and bearing (direction). Ideally, the navigation system uses a Global Positioning System (GPS) to determine the aircraft’s LAT/LONG position.  If  the  GPS  system  fails,  however,  the  navigation  system  can  then approximate the position by dead-reckoning it.<br/>The aircraft’s navigation controller subsystem has the following primary responsibilities:<br/>1.   <i>Autopilot (Automatic): </i>Based on the source and destination of the aircraft,  this subsystem can choose an appropriate flight path. During the entire flight period, it can also guide the aircraft by generating appropriate commands to the aircraft’s wings and engines to change the speed and bearing (i.e. direction) as required.<br/>2.   <i>Supporting Custom Flight Paths (Semi-Automatic): </i>This subsystem can  accept commands from the pilots such as a specific position’s latitude and  longitude (LAT/LONG). Then, it controls the aircraft’s speed and bearing to  get to the desired FTP that was indicated by the pilot.<br/>In order to perform such functionality, this subsystem needs to have continuous input from the aircraft’s navigation system, which reports the current position and altitude of the aircraft at all time. In addition, it needs to be able to command the aircraft’s wings and engines to change the speed and bearing.</p><h3>7.2   System Architecture</h3><p>Recall that software safety is only meaningful within the context of the system in which the software is used. As a result, it is mandatory to consider the system architecture as a whole to determine the safety aspects of <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem</span>.

This subsystem will not be considered any further in this case study.<br/>3.   <span class="s43">NavigationSubsystem</span>:  This  subsystem represents  the  navigation  system  that determines the current position, altitude, speed, and bearing of the aircraft through a GPS system and other technologies. Thus, it is safety-critical and is  assigned level  B,  as  the  &lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt;  (5.2.17)  stereotype  illustrates,  because  its failure prevents the pilots from performing their tasks correctly and  accurately, but the pilots can approximate the aircraft’s navigation information by observing ground landmarks. This subsystem will not be considered any further in this case study.<br/>4.   <span class="s43">LEDDisplaySubsystem</span>:  This  subsystem  represents  a  simple   Light-Emitting Diode (LED) display to the pilots showing continuous navigation information as it  is  read  from  the  “Navigation”  subsystem.  LEDs  are  a  classical  kind  of information display technology. Thus, it is safety-critical and is assigned level D, as  the  &lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt;  (5.2.17)  stereotype  illustrates,  because  its  failure increases  the  pilots’  workload  and  discomfort,  but  they   can  still  read  the navigation  information  from   <span class="s43">NavigationUserInterfaceSubsystem</span>.

It is safety-critical and is  assigned  level  C,  as  the  &lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt;  (5.2.17)  stereotype  illustrates, because its failure increases the pilots’ workload and discomfort and may cause injuries because the pilots will not necessarily be  able  to safely fly the aircraft without it as this would require them to use the mechanical steering wheels. It is partitioned away from <span class="s43">NavigationSubsystem</span>, as indicated by the &lt;&lt;Partition&gt;&gt; (5.2.18) stereotype, because it has a software  level that is lower than that of <span class="s43">NavigationSubsystem </span>(i.e.  level  C  is  lower  than  level  B).

It can be used to read navigation information         including         flight         paths,         and         to         command <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>to  use  the  autopilot  feature  or  to  fly  to specific   FTPs.   It   is   safety-critical   and   is   assigned   level   C,    as   the<br/>&lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; (5.2.17) stereotype illustrates, because its failure increases the pilots’ workload and discomfort and may cause injuries because the pilots will only          be          able          to          control          the          aircraft          through <span class="s43">MechanicalSteeringWheelSubsystem</span>. This subsystem will not be considered any further in this case study.</p><h3>7.3   Functional Requirements</h3><p>The          following          functional          requirements          are          assigned          to</p><p class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem<span class="p">:</span></p><p>FREQ 1     <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall be able to list  pre-determined flight paths for a requested source/destination pair.<br/>139</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>FREQ 2     <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall  provide  an   autopilot  feature where it flies the aircraft through a requested flight path.<br/>FREQ 3     <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall be able to fly the  aircraft to a requested FTP.<br/>FREQ 4     <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall provide the  capability to guide the pilots through a requested flight path when the pilot is controlling the aircraft through <span class="s43">MechanicalSteeringWheelsSubsystem</span>.<br/>FREQ 5     <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall be able to provide  navigation information received from <span class="s43">NavigationSubsystem</span>.</p><h3>7.4   Safety Assessment</h3><p>A safety assessment of <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>was performed based on the functional requirements listed in section 7.3 and the system architecture presented in Figure 12. This is common practice because such a safety assessment on the system helps identify potential hazards and their causes. This results in developing safety requirements to treat the hazards, which in turn impact the system and software design. Therefore, the safety assessment is performed at the early stages of the design because, unlike risk assessment, it emphasizes designing the system and software with safety in mind rather than adding safety features to a completed design.<br/>The safety assessment in this case study was performed using various methods to identify additional safety-related requirements. Each one of the following sections (7.4.1 – 7.4.4) first presents and explains a safety assessment method. A description and analysis of the various  safety  assessment  methods  can  be  found  in  [1].  Several  safety  assessment methods  are  used  in  practice  because  they  are  complementary.  Safety  assessment methods differ in terms of inputs, outputs, objectives, and scalability. (Refer to section<br/>2.1 for more detail.) Then, in each section, we apply the corresponding safety assessment method on the system, and only report on the results that are relevant to our case study<br/>(i.e., <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem</span>).<br/>140</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>Section 7.4.5 then presents safety requirements for <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem</span><br/>based on the safety assessments performed in sections 7.4.1 – 7.4.4.</p><h4>7.4.1    Action Error Analysis (AEA)</h4><p>AEA is a qualitative safety-analysis technique used to analyse human behaviour and identify actions that can potentially cause accidents. It focuses on potential deviations of human  behaviour  from  the  normal  or  intended  behaviour.  Examples  of  scenarios considered in this analysis include forgetting to do a step, doing a step at the wrong time, incorrect ordering of steps, taking too long to do a step, or doing an unintended step. Therefore, it uses a forward search strategy to identify what could result from such errors in human behaviour. It is very similar to FMEA, but it is applied to human behaviour instead [1]. More detailed discussions of AEA can be found in [1] and [42].<br/>The following potentially unsafe human actions, which could result in hazards, were analysed using this method:<br/>AEA 1   A     pilot     attempts     to     manually     control     the     aircraft     through <span class="s43">MechanicalSteeringWheelSubsystem </span>while  the  aircraft  is  in  autopilot mode.<br/>AEA 2   A pilot requests flying to an FTP that is in an unsafe area.<br/>AEA 3   A pilot requests flying to an FTP where the path to it requires  passing through an unsafe area.<br/>AEA 4   A pilot requests a long flight path or a far FTP that would cause the aircraft to run out of fuel before landing.</p><h4>7.4.2    Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)</h4><p>FMEA is a popular analysis technique, which was developed by reliability engineers. Therefore, it focuses on the failures of components and, using a forward search approach, analyses the effects of such failures. It is also used in safety assessments because the effects of such failures could include potential hazards and risks. When applied to safety<br/>141</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>assessments, however, it is important to realize that not all failures result in hazards or accidents. In addition, it pays little attention to human errors because it focuses on the failure  of  components.  Therefore,  FMEA  and  AEA  complement  each  other.  More detailed discussions of FMEA can be found in [1] and [43].<br/>Using       FMEA,       failures       that       would       result       in       the       failure       of <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>were identified. Such failures could potentially result in hazards because <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>is safety-critical. They include the  potential  failure  of  <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>itself  and  any  of  the subsystems on which it depends.<br/>The following failures, which could result in hazards, were identified using this method: FMEA 1    <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>fails.<br/>FMEA 2    <span class="s43">WingsAndEnginesSubsystem </span>fails.<br/>FMEA 3    <span class="s43">NavigationDatabaseSubsystem </span>fails. FMEA 4    <span class="s43">NavigationSubsystem </span>fails.</p><h4>7.4.3    Hazards and Operability Analysis (HAZOP)</h4><p>HAZOP is an analysis technique that assumes that accidents are caused by deviations from the design or operating intentions. Therefore, it encourages creative thinking about all the possible ways in which hazards or operating problems may arise as a result of using the system in a mode other than its intended operating conditions. Because HAZOP considers a design and investigates what hazards could be caused by each design and operating deviation, it can discover new hazards that were not previously identified. More detailed discussions of HAZOP can be found in [1] and [44].<br/>The following deviation from the operating intention, which could result in hazards, was identified using this method:<br/>142</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>HAZOP 1    The autopilot mode is being used when <span class="s43">NavigationSubsystem </span>is unable to use the GPS feature and is instead  dead-reckoning (i.e. periodically approximating) the aircraft’s position.</p><h4>7.4.4    Interface Analyses (IA)</h4><p>IA is an analysis method that is used to evaluate connections and relationships between components. It examines the interfaces between components and determines whether failures can be propagated between components. The types of problems that are often examined include, but are not limited to, failure to receive inputs from the connection, unstable connection, and erroneous output. IA is similar in use to HAZOP because interface problems are deviations from the intended design operation, but it is more general because it considers other types of problems. More detailed discussions of IA can be found in [1] and [45].<br/>The following connection problems, which could result in hazards, were identified using this method:</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse:collapse"><tr><td><p class="s21">IA 1</p></td><td><p class="s46">NavigationControllerSubsystem</p><p class="s46">WingsAndEnginesSubsystem<span class="s21">.</span></p></td><td><p class="s21">can</p></td><td><p class="s21">no</p></td><td><p class="s21">longer</p></td><td><p class="s21">communicate</p></td><td><p class="s21">with</p></td></tr><tr><td><p class="s21">IA 2</p></td><td><p class="s46">NavigationControllerSubsystem</p><p class="s46">NavigationSubsystem<span class="s21">.</span></p></td><td><p class="s21">can</p></td><td><p class="s21">no</p></td><td><p class="s21">longer</p></td><td><p class="s21">communicate</p></td><td><p class="s21">with</p></td></tr></table><h4>7.4.5    Safety Requirements</h4><p>The following safety requirements are assigned to <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem</span><br/>based on the results of the safety assessment performed above. Notice that sections 7.4.1<br/>- 7.4.4 describe the events that could occur and the hazards that could result from them, whereas  this  section  describes  the  positive  reactions  to  those  events,  which  would eliminate or reduce the hazards. The parenthesis specify the hazards that each safety requirement guards against:<br/>SREQ 1     <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall   disable   autopilot   and   FTP<br/>features when the pilot is using <span class="s43">MechanicalSteeringWheelSubsystem</span>,<br/>143</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>and       re-enable       them       when       the       pilot       stops       using</p><p class="s43">MechanicalSteeringWheelSubsystem <span class="p">(AEA 1).</span></p><p>SREQ 2     <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall be able to identify  whether a specific LAT/LONG position is in a safe area or not, and  not fly the aircraft to unsafe positions unless explicitly confirmed by the pilot (AEA<br/>2).<br/>SREQ 3     <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall be able to  determine whether flying to a specific LAT/LONG position requires  flying through unsafe areas or not, and not fly the aircraft through unsafe areas unless explicitly confirmed by the pilot (AEA 3).<br/>SREQ 4     <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall  alert  the  pilot  when  the  next<br/>FTP cannot be reached without having to refuel the aircraft (AEA 4).<br/>SREQ 5     When <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>fails, an alert  shall  be raised and,  until  <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>is  operational  again,  the pilot    shall    be    required    to    manually    fly    the    aircraft    using <span class="s43">MechanicalSteeringWheelsSubsystem </span>(FMEA 1).<br/>SREQ 6     <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall  ensure  that  the  autopilot  and<br/>FTP features are enabled only when all of the following conditions hold: SREQ 6.1  <span class="s43">WingsAndEnginesSubsystem </span>is functional (FMEA 2).<br/>SREQ 6.2  <span class="s43">NavigationDatabaseSubsystem </span>is functional (FMEA 3).<br/>SREQ 6.3  <span class="s43">NavigationSubsystem </span>is functional (FMEA 4).<br/>SREQ 6.4  <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>is  able  to  communicate  with</p><p class="s43">WingsAndEnginesSubsystem <span class="p">(IA 1).</span></p><p>SREQ 6.5  <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>is  able  to  communicate  with</p><p class="s43">NavigationSubsystem <span class="p">(IA 2).</span></p><p>144</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>SREQ 7     <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall require explicit confirmation to continue   autopilot   or   FTP   flight   modes   every   5   minutes   until <span class="s43">NavigationSubsystem </span>indicates that the GPS feature is functional again.

Sections  7.5.1  –  7.5.4  aim  at  further  defining  the  subsystem  by understanding its events of interest, and how the subsystem should react to those events. Section 7.5.1 explains how the events and reactions can be derived from the safety requirements. Section 7.5.2 defines the events that are of interest to the subsystem, and section 7.5.3 defines how the subsystem behaves, or reacts, in response to those events. Thus, they provide an event-reaction relationship that defines the system behaviour. To ensure that the system’s behaviour is complete with respect to the events and reactions, the reactions are traced to the events that caused them. This is explained in section 7.5.4.<br/>Once the subsystem’s behaviour is understood, its software design in presented in section<br/>7.5.5. While the limited space in the diagrams makes it difficult to list all the possible stereotypes and tagged values that could be used, the safety information that is modeled is varied enough to show different kinds of safety information, stereotypes, and tagged values. It is important to note that, in practice, a UML modeling tool would allow the designers to specify as many stereotypes and tagged values while giving them the choice to show or hide specific stereotypes (or stereotype categories such as a particular profile’s stereotypes)  on  diagrams  while  retaining  the  information  in  the  tool’s  database. Furthermore, the model is also stereotyped according to Gomaa’s class classification as presented in [7] and summarized in Appendix E.<br/>The discussions in the sections below will often cross-reference events and reactions through  their  numbers,  prefixed  by  either  an  “E”  for  events  or  “R”  for  reactions. Whenever an event is cross-referenced, the number between parenthesis represents its<br/>145</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>number as listed in section 7.5.2. Whenever a reaction is cross-referenced, similarly, the number between parenthesis represents its number as listed in section 7.5.3. For example, the    <span class="s43">ControllerFailed </span>(E5)    event    is    described    in   section   7.5.2,    but    the <span class="s43">DisableController </span>(R4) reaction is described in section 7.5.3.</p><h4>7.5.1    Identification of Events and Reactions</h4><p>To design safety into the system, it is important to identify all events (3.2.3.8) that could have safety implications, and the reactions (3.2.3.9) to those events. To identify the events, one needs to ask: Which inputs to the system, or changes in its state, should the system respond to because they may impact its safety? To identify the reactions, one needs to ask: How should the system behave when any of the identified events occurs? The  answers  to  those  questions  are  found  in  the  safety  requirements.  For  example, consider safety requirement SREQ 1 from section 7.4.5:<br/>NavigationControllerSubsystem shall disable autopilot and FTP features when  the  pilot  is  using  MechanicalSteeringWheelSubsystem,  and  re- enable          them          when          the          pilot          stops          using MechanicalSteeringWheelSubsystem (1091HAEA 1).<br/>From this requirement, one can identify at least two events of interest: (1) The event of when  the  pilot  starts  using  <span class="s43">MechanicalSteeringWheelSubsystem</span>;  (2)  The  event  of when  the  pilot  stops  using  <span class="s43">MechanicalSteeringWheelSubsystem</span>.  Also  from  this requirement,  and  from the  identified  events,  one  can  identify  at  least  the  following reactions: (1) The reaction of disabling the autopilot and FTP features when the pilot starts  using <span class="s43">MechanicalSteeringWheelSubsystem</span>;  (2)  The  reaction  of  enabling the autopilot        and        FTP        features        when        the        pilot        stops        using</p><p class="s43">MechanicalSteeringWheelSubsystem<span class="p">.</span></p><p>146</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><h4>7.5.2    Events</h4><p class="s47">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s47">SystemEvent (E1)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s48">{EffectOnSafetyDirection=Negative}</p><p class="s47">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt; IndependentSubsystemEvent (E2)</p><p class="s47">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt; DependentSubsystemEvent (E10)</p><p class="s47">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt; NavigationDatabaseEvent (E11)</p><p class="s48">NavigationDatabaseFailed (E12)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s48">{EffectOnSafetyDirection=Positive}</p><p class="s48">NavigationDatabaseRestored (E13)</p><p class="s47">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s47">PilotInputEvent (E7)</p><p class="s47">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s47">WingsAndEnginesEvent (E14)</p><p class="s47">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s47">NavigationEvent (E21)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt; ChangeFlightPath (E8)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s48">{EffectOnSafetyDirection=Negative}</p><p class="s48">WingsAndEnginesFailed (E15)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s48">{EffectOnSafetyDirection=Negative}</p><p class="s48">NavigationFailed (E22)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt; EditFTPList (E9)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s48">{EffectOnSafetyDirection=Negative, When=‘Aircraft is expected to run out of fuel’}</p><p class="s48">FuelShortageExpected (E3)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s48">{EffectOnSafetyDirection=Positive} WingsAndEnginesRestored (E16)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s48">{EffectOnSafetyDirection=Negative}</p><p class="s48">WingsAndEnginesConnectionLost (E17)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s48">{EffectOnSafetyDirection=Positive} NavigationRestored (E23)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s48">{EffectOnSafetyDirection=Negative}</p><p class="s48">NavigationConnectionLost (E24)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s48">{EffectOnSafetyDirection=Negative} FuelShortageNotExpected (E4)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s48">{EffectOnSafetyDirection=Negative, When=‘Aircraft is not expected to run out of fuel’}</p><p class="s48">ControllerFailed (E5)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s48">{EffectOnSafetyDirection=Positive}</p><p class="s48">ControllerRestored (E6)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;</p><p class="s48">{EffectOnSafetyDirection=Positive} WingsAndEnginesConnectionEstablished (E18)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;</p><p class="s48">{EffectOnSafetyDirection=Negative, EffectOnSafetyContext=‘Autopilot or FTP Mode is ON’}</p><p class="s48">WingsAndEnginesControlledByOtherSubsystem (E19)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;</p><p class="s48">{EffectOnSafetyDirection=Positive}</p><p class="s48">WingsAndEnginesNotControlled</p><p class="s48">ByOtherSubsystems (E20)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;</p><p class="s48">{EffectOnSafetyDirection=Positive} NavigationConnectionEstablished (E25)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s48">{EffectOnSafetyDirection=Negative} StartDeadReckoningAircraftPosition (E26)</p><p class="s48">&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s48">{EffectOnSafetyDirection=Positive} UseGPSForAircraftPosition (E27)</p><p><span><IMG width="559" height="515" src="A UML Profile for Developing Airworthiness-Compliant (RTCA DO-178B), Safety-Critical Software/Image_028.png"/></span></p><h4>Figure 13: NavigationControllerSubsystem’s events (structure).</h4><p>Figure 13 shows all the system events of interest. Each concrete class (i.e., leaf class in the generalization hierarchy) represents a unique event type, and an instantiation of a concrete event class represents a unique event. Each event class is stereotyped with<br/>&lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt;    (5.2.15)    to    indicate    that    it    is    an    event    of    interest,    and    its “EffectOnSafetyDirection” and “Context” tagged values are set where applicable.This figure is primarily used here to arrange events in a hierachy and therefore facilitate discussion and analysis.

More specifically:<br/>1.   <i>Every event causes at least one reaction: </i>Since all the reactions described  in section 7.5.3 have a positive effect on safety, every event that may  introduce hazards is being handled in a way that increases the level of safety by masking,<br/>157</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>reducing, or removing the hazard. Note, however, that reactions do not always cause other reactions to occur.<br/>2.   <i>Every reaction can be triggered by at least one event: </i>In essence, this means that none of the reactions will result in dead code that is never executed. In addition, a reaction’s   code   may   occur   if   any   of   a   number   of   events   occur   (e.g. <span class="s43">ChangeFlightPath </span>(E8)  occurs  if  either  <span class="s43">InvestigateFuelShortage </span>(R6)  or <span class="s43">EnsureFlightPathOverSafeAreas </span>(R7) occurs).<br/>3.   <i>Some reactions are triggered by other reactions: </i>the <span class="s43">RaiseSystemFailureAlert </span>(R9)  reaction  is  triggered  by  the   <span class="s43">DisableController </span>(R4)  reaction;  the <span class="s43">HideSystemFailureAlert </span>(R10) reaction is triggered by the <span class="s43">EnableController </span>(R3) reaction.<br/>4.   <i>Every event causes a finite number of reactions: </i>In other words, it is guaranteed that the triggering of an event would eventually cause a reaction  that does not trigger other reactions. If that was not the case, then the  system  could never restore itself to a steady-state.<br/>Note that we have initially defined our stereotypes (and associated tagged values) for a subset  of  the  UML  metamodel,  specifically  for  metaclasses  Class,  Operation,  and Relationship. The behavior suggested by these event-reaction relationships would, during a complete realistic design, also be modeled by one or several statechart diagrams. These statechart diagrams would specify which reactions (i.e., actions on transitions and states) result from which events (triggering transitions). The transitions’ guard conditions would then correspond to the “When” tagged value of the &lt;&lt;Reaction&gt;&gt; (5.2.16) stereotype above. This suggests that our UML profile needs to be extended to model elements of UML statechart diagrams. This will be considered in future work, and we do not foresee<br/>any major difficulty for doing so.<br/>158</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><h4>7.5.5    High-Level Design</h4><p>Figure 15 illustrates the <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>high-level design, which contains safety information indicating requirements traceability, certification information, and safety monitoring.

This will be discussed in detail here as each classes contributing to the implementation of a requirement will be explained. The discussion will say that a class <span class="s43">CLASS1 </span>implements requirement <span class="s43">REQ1 </span>if, as a minimum, class <span class="s43">CLASS1 </span>partially implements requirement <span class="s43">REQ1</span>.<br/>159</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>The diagram is stereotyped with &lt;&lt;SafetyContext&gt;&gt; (5.2.1) to indicate that it contains information  that  is  relevant  to  safety.  Furthermore,  it  is  also  stereotyped  with<br/>&lt;&lt;Requirement&gt;&gt; (5.2.9) twice. The first &lt;&lt;Requirement&gt;&gt; (5.2.9) stereotype has a “Kind” tagged value equal to “Functional” to indicate that it is a functional requirement, and its “Specification” tagged value is set to “Fulfills all FREQs” to indicate that the design in this diagram must fulfill all the FREQ functional requirements of the subsystem (section 7.3). The second &lt;&lt;Requirement&gt;&gt; (5.2.9) stereotype has a “Kind” tagged value equal to “Safety” to indicate that it is a safety requirement, and its “Specification” tagged value is set to “Fulfills all SREQs” to indicate that the design in this diagram must fulfill all SREQ safety requirements of the subsystem (section 7.4.5).<br/>Most classes in Figure 15 use the &lt;&lt;Rationale&gt;&gt; (5.2.14) stereotype and its “Reference” tagged value. For clarity and brevity, the “Reference” tagged value was used once to list more than one requirement. For example, <span class="s43">Controller </span>has a &lt;&lt;Rationale&gt;&gt; (In 5.2.14) stereotype with a “Reference” tagged value set to “FREQ 1, FREQ 2, FREQ 3, FREQ 4, FREQ 5, SREQ 2, SREQ 3”. This abbreviation is used in this , we say that a class <span class="s43">CLASS1 </span>depends on class <span class="s43">CLASS2 </span>if there is an association between <span class="s43">CLASS1 </span>and <span class="s43">CLASS2 </span>in which <span class="s43">CLASS1 </span>is the source end of the uni-directional association and <span class="s43">CLASS2 </span>is the target end. Additionally, we say that <span class="s43">CLASS1 </span>depends on <span class="s43">CLASS2 </span>if a usage dependency exists for <span class="s43">CLASS1 </span>on <span class="s43">CLASS2</span>, which would be the case study to indicate that the sterotype actually has several “Reference” tagged values, and each “Reference” tagged value identifies only if <span class="s43">CLASS2 </span>is a parameter to at least one requirement. Therefore, the {Reference=“FREQ<br/>1, FREQ 2, FREQ 3, FREQ 4, FREQ 5, SREQ 2, SREQ 3”} string is actually identical to<br/>{Reference=“FREQ       1”,       Reference=“FREQ       2”,       Reference=“FREQ       3”, Reference=“FREQ 4”, Reference=“FREQ 5”, Reference=“SREQ 2”, Reference=“SREQ<br/>3”}. Whereas the latter format is what the proposed UML profile defines and therefore would be used when the design is modeled in a UML modeling tool, we have used the former abbreviated format in the figuremethod in this section to make the UML diagram clearer and easier to understand.<br/>Similarly, the “Explanation” tagged value of the &lt;&lt;Rationale&gt;&gt; (5.2.14) stereotype is not shown in Figure 15 because the explanation text is large and would have cluttered the<br/>160</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>diagram. Instead, the explanation can be found below in the subsections describing each class: each time we provide the text (i.e., the value of the “Explanation” tagged value) that would be used by a UML CASE tool supporting our profile.<br/>The different classes in the class diagram of Figure 15 are now described in sections<br/>7.5.5.1 to 7.5.5.10.<br/>7.5.5.1       Description of class <span class="s43">Controller</span></p><p class="s43">Controller <span class="p">is the key and central element of the subsystem. It is stereotyped with</span></p><p>&lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;   (5.2.17)   and   assigned   software   level   C,   as   indicated   by   the “CriticalityLevel” tagged value, because its failure results in the failure of the entire subsystem,  which  is  assigned  software  level  C  itself.  Furthermore,  <span class="s43">Controller </span>is stereotyped with &lt;&lt;Handler&gt;&gt; (5.2.19) whose “HandleableEvent” tagged value is set to “PilotInputEvent” to indicate that it handles all concrete events that are subclasses of <span class="s43">PilotInputEvent </span>(E7).

One approach would be to design them as classes. In this case, the class diagram for each the events would be exactly the one shown in Figure 13, and the class diagram for reactions would be exactly the one shown in Figure 14. A concrete event instance is simply an instantiation of its corresponding class. This object instance would then be passed from a monitor, stereotyped with &lt;&lt;Monitor&gt;&gt; (5.2.20), to a handler<br/>&lt;&lt;Handler&gt;&gt; (5.2.19). A reaction would also be an instantiation of a reaction class. Executing it would simply correspond to passing an event object instance to a procedure in   the   reaction   object   instance.   For   example,   here   is   a   sample   code   for <span class="s43">ControllerMonitorAndHandler </span>illustrating how reactions to the <span class="s43">ChangeFlightPath </span>(E8) event are executed:</p><p class="s43">ChangeFlightPath event = new ChangeFlightPath (params); InvestigateFuelShortage reaction1 =</p><p class="s43">new InvestigateFuelShortage (params); EnsureFlightPathOverSafeAreas reaction2 =</p><p class="s43">new EnsureFlightPathOverSafeAreas (params);</p><p class="s43">reaction1.handle (event);</p><p class="s43">reaction2.handle (event);</p><p>However, it is not necessary to have a separate class for each reaction. In fact, only one procedure, in a Handler (3.2.3.12) class, is generally needed to describe and execute a reaction instead of an entire class, although this is dependent on the application details and the sizes of the events and reactions (i.e. it is up to the designers to ensure that events<br/>173</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>and reactions are appropriately defined). Therefore, it is often feasible to group all related reaction  procedures  together  and  include  them  in  the  class  that  is  stereotyped  with<br/>&lt;&lt;Handler&gt;&gt; (5.2.19). That way, the handler does not need to keep track on which reactions should occur in response to which events. This would simplify the design and implementation. Here is a sample code illustrating this concept:</p><p class="s43">switch (event.Kind)</p><p class="s43">{</p><p class="s43">case CHANGE_FLIGHT_PATH: investigateFuelShortage (event); ensureFlightPathOverSafeAreas (event); break;</p><p class="s43">case ...:</p><p class="s43">... etc.</p><p class="s43">}</p><p>Either way, the Handler class would be invoked as follows: <span class="s43">ChangeFlightPath event = new ChangeFlightPath (params); PersistentEventHandler.handle (event);</span><br/>Thus,  the  <span class="s43">PersistentEventHandler </span>static  class  would  know  exactly  that  it  should execute the <span class="s43">InvestigateFuelShortage </span>(R6) and <span class="s43">EnsureFlightPathOverSafeAreas </span>(R7) reactions. This is a better approach as it would relief the clients from knowing the reaction specifics. In other words, they can call the <span class="s43">handle </span>procedure of the event handler without needing to know what the event is and what its reactions are.<br/>The concepts of events and reactions in this research are related to the UML concepts of signals and operations. A signal is intended to indicate the occurrence of an event of interest. The occurrence of a signal could result in the occurrence of another signal, or in the invocation of an operation. Therefore, either a signal or an operation may be the response to a signal. Thus, signals and operations may be reactions to other signals (“events” in the safety analysis domain).<br/>In summary, structuring and interpreting events and reaction is an implementation detail rather than a significant design decision. Therefore, it will not be pursued any further in this case study.<br/>174</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><h3>7.6   Design Analysis</h3><p>Now that <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>is designed according to the functional and safety requirements, the design model is analysed according to the UML profile’s usage scenarios identified in section 2.4. This section will illustrate the usefulness of modeling safety information in the UML model using the proposed UML profile.</p><h4>7.6.1    USAGE 1: Provide Safety Requirements</h4><p>Safety requirements are provided by the safety and airworthiness engineers. In this case study, the safety requirements resulted from the safety assessment performed in section<br/>7.4, and the safety requirements were listed in section 7.4.5.<br/>Two     general     requirements     were     specified     in     the     class     diagram     for <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>in Figure 15 (see the top of the diagram). One of them was a functional requirement, which indicated that the class diagram must fulfill all FREQ requirements of the subsystem. The second one was a safety requirement, which indicated that the class diagram must fulfill all SREQ requirements of the subsystem. To ensure that every functional and safety requirement is addressed by at least one class, one needs to ensure that every functional and safety requirement is referenced by at least one class using an appropriate stereotype and its tagged values. The &lt;&lt;Rationale&gt;&gt; (5.2.14) stereotype is the most common for such usage. This is a step towards ensuring that the diagram fulfills those two high-level diagram requirements.<br/>In addition, safety (and functional) requirements were referenced in the UML model using the &lt;&lt;Rationale&gt;&gt; (5.2.14) stereotype. Each model element that implemented at least one safety (or functional) requirement was stereotyped with &lt;&lt;Rationale&gt;&gt; (5.2.14). Thus, the design was explicitly and precisely related to the safety requirements. This had several advantages. One particular advantage that is relevant for this usage scenario is that software engineers better consider safety requirements if they have to explicitly relate the design model elements to them. This improves the communication between software and airworthiness/safety engineers because software engineers are now better able to relate the safety requirements to their software designs.<br/>175</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><h4>7.6.2    USAGE 2: Design Safety Requirements in Systems</h4><p>Safety requirements were decomposed into events and reactions in section 7.5, which helped design the safety requirements in the software. Event handlers, which perform reactions to events, were designed and stereotyped with &lt;&lt;Handler&gt;&gt; (5.2.19). When events and reactions were modeled, either as a class or as an operation, they were stereotyped with &lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt; (5.2.15) and &lt;&lt;Reaction&gt;&gt; (5.2.16), respectively.<br/>As a result of decomposing safety requirements into events and reactions, designing safety  requirements  in  the  system  reduces  to  ensuring  that  safety-related  events  are detected and that the relevant reactions are properly executed. The events are listed and described in section 7.5.2, and the reactions are listed and described in section 7.5.3. This can be ensured by analysing event handling classes in Figure 15, which were stereotyped with  &lt;&lt;Handler&gt;&gt;  (5.2.19),  and  ensuring  that  the  “HandleableEvent”  tagged  values include all previously identified safety-related events. In addition, it must be ensured that all previously identified safety-related reactions are included in the “PerformedReaction” tagged values, and that all such reactions are properly executed in response to the events that trigger them. This helps ensure that all previously identified safety requirements are accounted for in the design.<br/>All  classes  that  implement  safety  requirements  are  stereotyped  with  &lt;&lt;Rationale&gt;&gt; (5.2.14) and their “Reference” tagged values explicitly identify all the requirements that they  implement.  Therefore,  another  way  to  ensure  that  the  safety  requirements  are accounted for in the design is to analyse the UML model and identify all &lt;&lt;Rationale&gt;&gt; (5.2.14) stereotypes. Then, their “Reference” tagged values are analysed to ensure that every safety requirement is referenced by at least one class. A class references a safety requirement if it implements it or at least helps implement it.<br/>One particular use of the &lt;&lt;Rationale&gt;&gt; (5.2.14) stereotype and its “Reference” tagged value is to associate reactions to the safety requirements that they implement. This is evident in Figure 14 as each modeled reaction is stereotyped with &lt;&lt;Rationale&gt;&gt; (5.2.14) to identify the safety requirements that it implements.<br/>176</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>Since  this  is  a  highly-safety  critical  subsystem  that  has  almost  as  many  safety requirements  as  functional  requirements,  safety-monitoring  is  emphasized.  Safety monitors  are  needed  to  design  the  safety  requirements  in  the  software.  Thus,  that subsystem has several safety monitors, one for each subsystem on which it depends and one for itself. The monitors can be identified by analysing the model and identifying all classes that are stereotyped with &lt;&lt;Monitor&gt;&gt; (5.2.20). Each monitor class explicitly identifies  what  it  monitors  through  the  “MonitoredEntity”  tagged  value.  Therefore, <span class="s43">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>will be able to track subsystem and class failures and ensure that this does not cause any safety hazards. In fact, once a monitor detects an event of  interest,  it  notifies  an  appropriate  event  handler,  which  is  stereotyped  with<br/>&lt;&lt;Handler&gt;&gt; (5.2.19) itself.<br/>The monitors were designed to detect the safety-critical events of interest to the safety requirements. Once such an event is detected, the appropriate event handler is notified. Once notified, the event handler executes the corresponding reaction for each event. The reactions are intended to alleviate the safety hazards introduced by each event, which is indicated  by  stereotyping  each  reaction  with  &lt;&lt;Reaction&gt;&gt;  (5.2.16)  and  setting  its “EffectOnSafetyDirection” tagged value to “Positive”. The safety monitoring classes, which     are     stereotyped     with     &lt;&lt;Monitor&gt;&gt;     (5.2.20)     in     the     design     are <span class="s43">WingsAndEnginesMonitor</span>,  <span class="s43">NavigationDatabaseMonitor</span>,  <span class="s43">NavigationMonitor</span>,  and <span class="s43">ControllerMonitorAndHandler</span>.  The  event  handlers,  stereotyped  with  &lt;&lt;Handler&gt;&gt; (5.2.19)       in       the       design       are       <span class="s43">ExternalSubsystemsEventHandler   </span>and <span class="s43">ControllerMonitorAndHandler</span>.</p><h4>7.6.3    USAGE 3: Justify Design Decisions</h4><p>Justifying  design  decisions  is  captured  in  the  “Explanation”  tagged  value  of  the<br/>&lt;&lt;Rationale&gt;&gt; (5.2.14) stereotype. In this case study, a detailed explanation on how the class  implements  each  safety  requirement,  and  often  even  functional  requirement, assigned to it was discussed. This explanation was presented in section 7.5.5 and each occurrence was explicitly identified as the value of an “Explanation” tagged value.<br/>177</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><h4>7.6.4    USAGE 4: Monitor Safety</h4><p>There are many approaches to monitoring the design and ensuring that it fulfills safety requirements. One way is to ensure that each safety requirement has design elements traceable to it. This case study has used the &lt;&lt;Rationale&gt;&gt; (5.2.14) stereotype to trace design elements to safety requirements and provide justifications for this. The following search query can be executed to determine which model elements. Including classes and reactions, are traceable to (e.g. implement) safety requirements:</p><p class="s43">SEARCH FOR all model elements STEREOTYPED WITH (&lt;&lt;Rationale&gt;&gt;)</p><p>The results can be analysed to determine how safety requirements were designed into the system in USAGE 2, and the “Explanation” tagged value of the &lt;&lt;Rationale&gt;&gt; (5.2.14) stereotype can be read to determine the justifications, performed in USAGE 3, for the design decisions performed in USAGE 2.<br/>Executing this search query and then sorting the results per software requirement (i.e. according to the “Reference” tagged value of the &lt;&lt;Rationale&gt;&gt; stereotype) tells us which classes and reactions implement each safety requirement. Notice that we do not have  events  stereotyped  with  &lt;&lt;Rationale&gt;&gt;  (5.2.14)  because  they  do  not  contain executable code that implements safety requirements. The results (classes and reactions) of the above query for each safety requirement are:<br/>SREQ 1      <span class="s43">WingsAndEnginesMonitor</span>,   <span class="s43">ExternalSubsystemsEventHandler</span>,</p><p class="s43">EnableController <span class="p">(R3),   </span>DisableController <span class="p">(R4)</span></p><p>SREQ 2      <span class="s43">Controller</span>,   <span class="s43">SafePointDeterminator</span>,</p><p class="s43">EnsureFlightPathsOverSafeAreas <span class="p">(R7)</span></p><p>SREQ 3      <span class="s43">Controller</span>,   <span class="s43">SafePointDeterminator</span>,</p><p class="s43">PathProjector<span class="p">,   </span>EnsureFlightPathsOverSafeAreas <span class="p">(R7)</span></p><p>SREQ 4      <span class="s43">ControllerMonitorAndHandler</span>,   <span class="s43">InvestigateFuelShortage </span>(R6),</p><p class="s43">RaiseFuelShortageExpectedAlert <span class="p">(R11),</span></p><p class="s43">HideFuelShortageExpectedAlert <span class="p">(R12)</span></p><p>SREQ 5      <span class="s43">ControllerMonitorAndHandler</span>,   <span class="s43">RaiseSubsystemFailureAlert </span>(R9),</p><p class="s43">HideSubsystemFailureAlert <span class="p">(R10).</span></p><p>SREQ 6      <span class="s43">WingsAndEnginesMonitor</span>,   <span class="s43">NavigationDatabaseMonitor</span>,</p><p class="s43">NavigationMonitor<span class="p">,   </span>ExternalSubsystemsEventHandler<span class="p">,</span></p><p class="s43">EnableController <span class="p">(R3),   </span>DisableController <span class="p">(R4),</span></p><p class="s43">RaiseSubsystemFailureAlert <span class="p">(R9), </span>HideSubsystemFailureAlert <span class="p">(R10)</span></p><p>SREQ 7      <span class="s43">NavigationMonitor</span>, <span class="s43">ExternalSubsystemsEventHandler</span>,<br/>178</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p class="s43">ControllerMonitorAndHandler<span class="p">, and </span>RequirePilotConfirmation <span class="p">(R8)</span></p><p>Furthermore, monitoring safety includes ensuring that each event that can have negative effect on safety has one or more appropriate reactions that have a positive effect on safety. This basically means that all hazards caused by events must be treated, and technically removed, by reactions. Thus, each class stereotyped with &lt;&lt;Event&gt;&gt; (5.2.15) must be referenced at least once by a “ConsequenceOf” tagged value of a &lt;&lt;Reaction&gt;&gt; (5.2.16) stereotype of some class. In this case study, this was presented in sections 7.5.4 and 7.5.4, specifically in Figure 14 and Table 5, respectively.<br/>Furthermore,  one  must  ensure  that  all  the  safety-related  events  are  detectable  by monitors.   This   is   ensured   through   the   “DetectableEvent”   tagged   value   of   the<br/>&lt;&lt;Monitor&gt;&gt; (5.2.20) stereotype. Notice that a monitor can recognize events, but it does not know which reactions may execute in response to each event. In fact, this is the responsibility of an event handler. The following search query can be executed to obtain a list of monitors:</p><p class="s43">SEARCH FOR all model elements STEREOTYPED WITH (&lt;&lt;Monitor&gt;&gt;)</p><p>Executing   this   query   on   the   design   in   Figure   15   gives   the   following   result: <span class="s43">ControllerMonitorAndHandler</span>,   <span class="s43">WingsAndEnginesMonitor</span>,   <span class="s43">NavigationDatabase- Monitor</span>, and <span class="s43">NavigationMonitor</span>.<br/>Then, looking into the “DetectableEvent” tagged value of the &lt;&lt;Monitor&gt;&gt; (5.2.20) stereotype for each of the classes in the result above tells us which events are detected by the identified monitors. This tells us whether all events of interest are detectable (i.e. the design of monitors is complete) or not.<br/>In  addition,  events  detected  by  monitors  must  be  handled  by  event  handlers.  The “EventHandler” tagged value of the &lt;&lt;Monitor&gt;&gt; (5.2.20) stereotype for each monitor class identifies the classes that the monitor notifies when any of the events represented by the “DetectableEvent” tagged value occurs.<br/>This case study contained two event handlers, each of which explicitly specifies the events it can handle and the reactions that it performs in response to those events.

The profile was based on the safety- related concepts that were extracted from the airworthiness standard as well as their refined  concepts.  As  a  result,  the  UML  extensions  provided  by  this  profile  are  a consequence of the concepts emphasized by the airworthiness standard.<br/>For example, the airworthiness standard emphasized traceability across requirements, design, and source code. The proposed profile provides specific extensions to model traceability  of  design  elements  to  requirements,  deviation  of  design  elements  from original  requirements,  requirements  in  the  UML  model,  justification  of  design  and implementation styles according to requirements, and partitioning of the architecture according to the requirements. A detailed analysis on how the UML profile can be used to fulfill each information requirement is presented in section 8.1.<br/>Furthermore, this research has shown how a software model using an appropriate UML profile  can  be  used  to  effectively  generate  airworthiness-related  information.  Such information can be submitted to the certification authorities, or it can be used by the airworthiness engineers to track how software evolves over the lifetime of a project from an airworthiness point of view.<br/>The profile’s completeness and usefulness was validated by performing a case study. An aircraft’s  navigation  subsystem  was  defined  and  analysed  by  performing  a  safety assessment. It was then modeled using the proposed UML profile. Analysing the model showed  that  the  UML  profile  effectively  supported  the  previously  identified  usage scenarios for safety information. In addition, it is effective in tracing model elements to safety  requirements  and  in  automatically  generating  certification  information  from  a UML model.<br/>To achieve the results presented above, this research had to define the used safety-related concepts precisely.

Furthermore, each safety related concept was described in detail, and attributes were defined to describe the various aspects and dimensions of each concept. A  conceptual model  (class  diagram)  was  also  defined  and  presented,  which  precisely  defined  the relationships  across  safety-related  concepts  and  modeled  them  as  associations  and inheritance relationships. Furthermore, the profile precisely defined the tagged values for each stereotype including its type and multiplicity, and mapped each stereotype and its tagged values to the refined concepts and their attributes and relationships.<br/>It is also important to note that this UML profile builds on top of existing UML model diagrams within a project. In other words, using this UML profile does not require the software engineers to create new diagrams but they must stereotype model elements accordingly. Therefore, the amount of effort involved in using this profile is minimal. This also contribute towards improving communication between safety and airworthiness engineers on the one hand, and software engineers on the other hand.</p><h3>8.1   Fulfilling Requirements</h3><p>The proposed UML profile was defined based on the refined safety-related concepts specified in section 3.2. As section 5 illustrates, there exists a stereotype for each of the refined concepts. Therefore, the proposed UML profile is able to model all the refined concepts.

Numerous examples of its usage have been presented (section  5.3).  Furthermore,  the  profile  has  been  applied  in  a  case  study  (section  7) involving an aircraft navigation controller system – a key software element in every aircraft. Future work could include applying the profile for other systems in diverse organizations, and then soliciting the engineers participating in those projects to identify the strengths and weaknesses of this profile. Such solicitations can be used to generate qualitative and quantitative results in an approach similar to the one used in [46].<br/>This  research  has  focused  on  modeling  safety  information  in  class  diagrams.  It demonstrated how the proposed UML profile’s stereotypes and tagged values can be used to model information in class diagrams. There was little discussion of other types of<br/>185</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>diagrams, such as dynamic diagrams including object diagrams and statecharts. This has been  left  for  future  work.  However,  the  proposed  UML  profile  should  be  easily transferable for dynamic diagrams.<br/>The proposed UML profile lists the UML meta classes on which each stereotype may be applied (section 5.1). This list may not necessarily be sufficient for all usages. More specifically, certain applications of this profile may determine that it is useful to apply certain stereotypes on UML meta classes that are not listed here. Nevertheless, this will form the path in which this profile can evolve in the future.<br/>The refined safety-related concepts (section 3.2), which formed the basis of the UML profile,  are  mostly  based  on  the  general  safety-related  concepts  identified  in  the airworthiness standard [4]. A standard is normally written in a high-level language as to not restrict the developers following it. Different projects have different airworthiness requirements and/or technical solutions to airworthiness requirements, and hence may have  additional  refined  concepts.  This  is  because  UML  models  can  be  used  as  an interface between safety engineers and software developers. This may introduce the need for additional profile stereotypes and tagged values.<br/>Although airworthiness is a subset of safety, it is specific to the aerospace industry. Many other industries exist where safety-critical software is used such as the medical, nuclear, transport, and defence industries. This research was based on the airworthiness standard, and  therefore  is  intended  to  meet  requirements  of  the  aerospace  industry.  Those requirements may or may not be sufficient in other industries that use different safety- related standards. However, an attempt has been made in this research to generalize results  as  much  as  possible  without  compromising  the  ability  to  model  specific airworthiness concepts and needs. Therefore, this UML profile should be easily tailorable and applicable to other industries.<br/>It was initially thought that it would be best to propose a UML profile that would be as compliant as possible with existing OMG UML profiles. However, it was found that it was better to define concepts for which similar stereotypes existed in other profiles (e.g.<br/>&lt;&lt;Requirement&gt;&gt;  (5.2.9)  stereotype  is  similar  to  the  &lt;&lt;QoSConstraint&gt;&gt;  and  its<br/>186</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>subtypes in the QoS and FT OMG UML profile [5]). This redefinition allowed this profile to be simple, clear, and most importantly self-contained and independent of other existing profiles. This is important from a maintainability point of view because we may not necessarily need to modify this profile if other OMG UML profiles are revised and newer versions are available.<br/>While some of its stereotypes and tagged values can be used to model safety-related information for systems, this UML profile has focused on modeling them for software. This is jusitified by the fact that the airworthiness standard [4] focuses on software itself. Nevertheless, it may be useful to model such information for systems in future work. In that regard, the OMG System Modeling Language [47], which resuses and extends a subset of UML [30] to model systems, may be helpful. In fact, it may be merged with UML to constitute the base modeling language for a new systems and software UML profile.<br/>Certain extension mechanisms that describe the code were added. Examples of these include using &lt;&lt;ImplementationStyle&gt;&gt; (5.2.11) to identify recursive code, or code that dynamically allocates memory. Another example is using the &lt;&lt;Complexity&gt;&gt; (5.2.24) stereotype to identify constraints on the level of code nesting. While they were provided here for completeness and their need in software certification, some of them are generally better addressed by a software code analysis tool that could parse software code, analyse it, and extract this information. The later approach would provide more complete and accurate results, and it would relieve the developers from maintaining this information in the model. Therefore, it may be more appropriate to use such stereotypes and tagged values as placeholders for data entered by software analysis tools. This UML profile does not specify the source of the information entered by the software engineers. Thus, a possible future extension could explicitly address this distinction and potentially provide two different values for each piece of information – a specified value, which is entered by the engineers to indicate requirements, and an analysis value, which is entered by a tool to indicate a predicted or measured value. Then, a tool can compare those two sets of<br/>values to detect violations.<br/>187</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>Most enumeration tagged values for some stereotypes were left open for extension by the users of this profile. This recognizes the fact that each software application may have specific needs or usages whose level of detail that is not addressed here. Therefore, this gives flexibility in a seemingly open UML profile. However, this UML profile lists sample values for each enumeration type that are deemed most useful. Thus, users of this UML profile do not need to do extra work in defining the enumeration values unless they truly need to.<br/>Search  queries  on  UML  models  were  used  to  illustrate  how  certification-relevant information can be extracted from a UML model. Those search queries were specified in a Structured Query Language (SQL)-like textual language. This could be refined and eventually lead into the development of an SQL-variant language that is used specifically to search and query UML models. Such a language should be defined such as it is independent of the UML profiles used.<br/>Alternatively, the integration of EMF and OCL seems to be a promising integration of technologies to query UML models. The current state of this technology does not support querying  UML  models  for  model  elements  according  to  criteria  specifying  the stereotypes and tagged values applied on the model elements. However, EMF and OCL should be easily extensible to support this because it already supports some form of querying UML models and class objects. Such an extension would be supportive of this<br/>UML profile as it will allow developers to dynamically query this information.<br/>188</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><h2>9   SUMMARY</h2><p>This research has investigated the relationship between UML and software safety. The airworthiness standard [4] is widely considered as the de-facto safety standard in the aerospace  industry.  Therefore,  modeling  software  that  has  to  be  developed  in  an environment  satisfying  the  airworthiness  standard  was  considered.  Since  UML  has become the de-facto software modeling language, it was fitting to define a UML profile for  modeling  safety-critical  software.  Therefore,  even  high-level  requirements  were identified for a UML profile to be able to effectively model safety-critical software developed under the airworthiness standard.<br/>The airworthiness standard was analysed to determine safety-related concepts of interest. A list of 65 safety-related concepts was formed, and the concepts were categorized in eight   different   but   related   categories:   safety,   reliability,   integrity,   performance, concurrency, certification, design, and configuration.<br/>Given the language difference between standards and UML modeling techniques, the 65 safety-related concepts were refined into 27 concepts that were more appropriate from a software modeling perspective. This refined list of concepts removed duplication across similar concepts, and it defined additional concepts that were not covered by the original<br/>65. The 27 refined safety-related concepts were explained in detail and their inter-concept relationships were formalized through a conceptual model. This allowed us to define 54 information requirements for a candidate UML profile to model those concepts. Those 54 information requirements were traced back to the original 7 high-level concepts.<br/>After analyzing several existing UML profiles and concluding that they did not fulfill an acceptable percentage of the 54 information requirements, a UML profile was proposed. The profile, composed of 32 stereotypes and their tagged values, was presented in detail. Several examples of using the profile were presented and explained in detail. The profile fulfilled the 54 information requirements and guidance was presented on how it can be used to fulfill each one of the information requirements.<br/>189</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>One specific usage of the profile was the ability to automatically provide airworthiness and certification information from a UML model. Therefore, examples of such usage were presented. Each example identified a specific need from the airworthiness standard, and then it presented search queries that a UML modeling tool can execute on a model employing the proposed profile to automatically generate the required information. This is handy for submitting software-related information to the certification authority as well as continuous project monitoring and control by managers and airworthiness engineers that are likely to be less experienced with software.<br/>The UML profile was validated by using it to design and analyse an aircraft’s navigation controller subsystem – a key element in every aircraft. The overall system’s architecture was presented and explained, and then the navigation controller’s subsystem’s functional requirements were defined. Then, a safety assessment using the AEA, FMEA, HAZOP, and  IA  methods  was  performed,  which  identified  11  safety  hazards  relevant  to  the subsystem under study. Those resulted in 7 safety requirements for the subsystem’s software. The subsystem was then designed using the UML profile, and an analysis of the model was performed. The analysis showed that the resultant UML model contained information on how the model elements were traceable to the safety requirements, as well as additional information relevant to the certification authorities.<br/>Future work in this area could include using the profile in real-life projects and soliciting participating stakeholders for improvement information.<br/>190</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><h2>REFERENCES</h2><p>[1] Nancy G.

class="s43">NavigationController <span class="p">controls the aircraft’s flight paths. Therefore, it is a safety- critical   element.   This   is   marked   explicitly   on   the   diagram   by   stereotyping </span>NavigationController <span class="p">with  a  &lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt;  (5.2.17)  stereotype.  Because  the failure of this system can result in conditions difficult to handle by the aircraft’s crew, this class has been assigned software level C. This is indicated by the “CriticalityLevel” tagged value of the &lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; (5.2.17) stereotype.</span></p><p class="s43">NavigationController <span class="p">needs to know the allowed flight paths of the aircraft. In this example,  </span>SafeFlightPaths <span class="p">serves  as  the  database  that  contains  all  the  navigation information relevant to the currently needed flight paths. It is safety-critical because a safety-critical  class,  namely  </span>NavigationController<span class="p">,  depends  on  it.  This  is  marked explicitly on the diagram by stereotyping it with a &lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; (5.2.17) stereotype and assigning it a software level equal to at least that of the class that depends on it as indicated by the “CriticalityLevel” tagged. The developers of this navigation controller system decided to purchase COTS software and use it to store the flight paths. This is indicated in the diagram by stereotyping </span>SafeFlightPaths <span class="p">with &lt;&lt;Nature&gt;&gt; (5.2.13) and setting the “Kind” tagged value to “COTS”.</span></p><p>For the aircraft’s flight paths to be meaningful, maps of the world are needed. They are necessary for verifying the safe flight paths as well as displaying them to the pilots. Unlike the flight paths, they are static information that rarely change, and therefore they are maintained as a separate class outside of <span class="s43">SafeFlightPaths</span>. They are maintained in <span class="s43">CurrentlyUsedWorldMaps</span>,  which  contains  the  world  maps  that  are  needed  for  the current    flight.    It    is    safety-critical    because    a    safety-critical    class,    namely <span class="s43">SafeFlightPaths</span>,  depends  on  it.

Hence,  it  is  stereotyped  with<br/>&lt;&lt;SafetyContext&gt;&gt;  (5.2.1).  In  addition,  COTS  software  is  a  crucial  element  of  the software’s certification aspects in airworthiness. Therefore, they must be declared to the certification    authorities.    For    this    reason,    this    diagram    is    stereotyped    with<br/>&lt;&lt;CertificationContext&gt;&gt; (5.2.6) to indicate that it contains information that is highly<br/>relevant to the certification authorities.</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;SafetyContext&gt;&gt;</p><p><span><IMG width="547" height="91" src="A UML Profile for Developing Airworthiness-Compliant (RTCA DO-178B), Safety-Critical Software/Image_034.png"/></span></p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;CertificationContext&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;state dependent control&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">{CriticalityLevel=C} NavigationController</p><p class="s27">1  Reads  1</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;entity&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">{CriticalityLevel=C}</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;Nature&gt;&gt; {Kind=COTS} SafeFlightPaths</p><p class="s27">1  Based On  1</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;entity&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">{CriticalityLevel=C} CurrentlyUsedWorldMaps</p><h4>Figure 17: Aircraft’s navigation controller using COTS software (structure).</h4><h3>G.2 Software Partitioning</h3><p>Software  partitioning  is  a  technique  for  providing  isolation  between  functionally independent software components to contain and/or isolate faults and potentially reduce the effort of the software verification process. It prevents specific interactions and cross- coupling interference [1]. Its key advantages are in separating safety-critical software elements that have different safety levels, so that the failure of the less critical software does not result in the failure of the more critical software.<br/>The example in Figure 18 shows another section of a navigation system. This system, which can be put on auto-pilot, has a steering controller that is highly safety-critical. <span class="s43">SteeringController </span>controls the steering of the aircraft and its movement. Therefore, it is  highly  safety-critical  and  is  assigned  software  level  B.  Thus,  it  is  stereotyped<br/>&lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; (5.2.17) and its “CriticalityLevel” tagged value is set to level B.<br/>Because it is highly safety-critical, it also employs defensive programming methods to<br/>236</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>protect against unsafe inputs, whether they are manual input from the pilot through <span class="s43">PilotKeyboardInterface</span>,   or   from   the   software’s   auto   pilot   system   through <span class="s43">AutoPilotController</span>. <span class="s43">SteeringController </span>does not perform any action that requires the aircraft to fly on an altitude below 100 meters unless the aircraft is in the process of landing.   Therefore,   it   is   stereotyped   with   &lt;&lt;Defensive&gt;&gt;   (5.2.27)   and   has   a “DefendableInput” tagged value set to “Altitude &lt; 100 m”. It also does not perform any action that requires the aircraft to change its flight direction in angles of greater than 90 degrees. Thus, another instance of the “DefendableInput” tagged value is set to “Angle &gt;<br/>90  deg”.  In  both  cases,  <span class="s43">SteeringController </span>reports  that  an  illegal  operation  has occurred by exeuting the <span class="s43">ReportIllegationOperation </span>reaction procedure, as evident from the “Reaction” tagged value that is set to “ReportIllegalOperation” .</p><p class="s43">AutoPilotController   <span class="p">is      also      safety-critical,      but      less      critical      than </span>SteeringController<span class="p">. This is because the failure of </span>AutoPilotController <span class="p">only results in inconvenience for the pilots rather than significantly compromising the level of safety. If the auto pilot feature fails, the pilots can always manually control the aircraft through </span>PilotKeyboardInterface <span class="p">or   some   other   mechanical   device   inputs.   Therefore, </span>AutoPilotController <span class="p">was  assigned  software  level  D.  Thus,  it  is  stereotyped  with</span></p><p>&lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; (5.2.17) and its “CriticalityLevel” tagged value is set to level D. The interesting thing to note in this example is that <span class="s43">AutoPilotController </span>was partitioned from <span class="s43">SteeringController </span>for this very reason – if the auto pilot feature fails, the steering controller can still execute correctly and ensure the safe flight of the aircraft. This is stated in the model by stereotyping <span class="s43">AutoPilotController </span>with &lt;&lt;Partition&gt;&gt; (5.2.18) and using its “PartitionedFrom” tagged value, set to “SteeringController”, and “Explanation”  tagged  value,  set  to  “Lower  Criticality  Level”,  to  specify  this  exact information.</p><p class="s43">ConvertibleSteeringInformation <span class="p">is used by </span>PilotDisplayInterface <span class="p">to display the current aircraft steering information. What is special about this class is that it can read the information from </span>SteeringController <span class="p">and convert it to appropriate units for the pilots such  as  conversion  from  metric  units  to  imperial  units,  and  vice-versa.  Again, </span>ConvertibleSteeringInformation <span class="p">was partitioned away from </span>SteeringController</p><p>237</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>because it is only relevant for displaying the information to the pilots. If it fails, the aircraft    can    still    resume    safe    flight    through    either    manual    input    through <span class="s43">PilotKeyboardInterface </span>or auto pilot through <span class="s43">AutoPilotController</span>. As a result, <span class="s43">ConvertibleSteeringInformation </span>was stereotyped with &lt;&lt;Partition&gt;&gt; (5.2.18) and its “PartitionedFrom” and “Explanation” tagged values were used to specify that it was partitioned from <span class="s43">SteeringController </span>because it was “Not Safety Critical”.<br/>It is clear from this discussion that this example has emphasis on safety. Therefore, the diagram was stereotyped with &lt;&lt;SafetyContext&gt;&gt; (5.2.1). It should also be noted that partitioning information has to be submitted to the certification authorities. Therefore, the diagram was also stereotyped with &lt;&lt;CertificationContext&gt;&gt; (5.2.6). Finally, we also decided to stereotype it with &lt;&lt;DesignContext&gt;&gt; (5.2.7) because it is the result of design decisions on how software classes are organized with respect to safety.

A    direct    positive    result    of    the    partitioning    in    this    example    is    that <span class="s43">AutoPilotController </span>and  <span class="s43">ConvertibleSteeringInformation </span>do  not  have  to  go<br/>238</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>through     the     rigorous     development     and     testing     methods     required     for</p><p class="s43">SteeringController<span class="p">, which is of level B.</span></p><h3>G.3 Requirements and Traceability</h3><p>The example in Figure 19 shows safety-related requirements in the aircraft steering controller system presented in Figure 18.   Most of the stereotypes on the classes were explained in Appendix G.2. Therefore, only new stereotypes are explained here. Such systems are generally safety-critical, and are often allocated safety requirements. As a result, this diagram has been stereotyped with &lt;&lt;SafetyContext&gt;&gt; (5.2.1).<br/>Generally, a project identifies high-level safety requirements that must be fulfilled. Then, low-level  safety  requirements  are  developed  to  ensure  that  the  high-level  goals  are fulfilled. This diagram specifies and elaborates on a safety goal that was identified for this model, namely to ensure that the aircraft always flies in “Safe Flight Paths”. This goal is captured in the diagram by stereotyping it with &lt;&lt;Requirement&gt;&gt; (5.2.9). The “ID” tagged value specified the unique ID of the requirement. The “Kind” tagged value is set to “Safety” to identify that this is a safety-related requirement, and its “Specification” tagged value states what the requirement is, namely ensuring “Safe Flight Paths”.<br/>Because of its high software level, <span class="s43">SteeringController </span>is checked for correctness using a formal method, namely “Theorem-Proving”. Therefore, it is stereotyped with<br/>&lt;&lt;Formalism&gt;&gt; (5.2.23) and its “Method” tagged value is set to “Theorem-Proving”. Its<br/>“Kind” tagged value is set to “Full” to indicate that a fully formal method is used.</p><p class="s43">PilotKeyboardInterface <span class="p">serves as an input interface to the pilot. The pilot can use it to change the flight path of the aircraft. </span>PilotKeyboardInterface <span class="p">has been assigned a safety requirement to request confirmation from the pilots whenever they wish to change the flight path. Therefore, it was stereotyped with &lt;&lt;Requirement&gt;&gt; (5.2.9). Its “ID” tagged value specifies the unique ID of the requirement, which is “LREQ 1”. Its “Kind” tagged  value  was  set  to  “Safety”  to  indicate  that  it  is  a  safety  requirement.  Its “OfRequirement” tagged value specifies the high-level requirement that this low-level requirement can be traced to. In this example, it is the “HREQ 1” high-level requirement</span></p><p>239</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>that  was  applied  as  a  stereotype  on  the  diagram.  The  “Specification”  tagged  value specifies that there must be a user confirmation for every path change.<br/>The second safety requirement for “HREQ 1” was assigned to the association between</p><p class="s43">AutoPilotController <span class="p">and </span>SteeringController<span class="p">. The association was stereotyped with</span></p><p>&lt;&lt;Requirement&gt;&gt; (5.2.9) whose “Kind” tagged value is also set to “Safety”. Its “ID” tagged value specifies the unique ID of the requirement. The “OfRequirement” tagged value specifies that this requirement is traceable to the “HREQ 1” requirement. The “Specification” tagged value specifies that the association must ensure that the “Chosen Aircraft Flight Path is in Safe Flight Paths Set”. Therefore, <span class="s43">AutoPilotController </span>must not command <span class="s43">SteeringController </span>to fly in a flight path that is not in the safe flight paths set.</p><p class="s43">AutoPilotController <span class="p">determines whether a particular flight path is allowed or not by reading the data managed by </span>SafeFlightPaths<span class="p">.

Therefore, it was stereotyped with</span></p><p>&lt;&lt;Rationale&gt;&gt; whose “Reference” tagged value is set to “LREQ 2” to identify the<br/>requirement whose existence resulted developing this class.<br/><span><IMG width="554" height="238" src="A UML Profile for Developing Airworthiness-Compliant (RTCA DO-178B), Safety-Critical Software/Image_036.png"/></span></p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;SafetyContext&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;Requirement&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">{ID=“HREQ 1”, Kind=Safety, Specification=“Safe Flight Paths”}</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;entity&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;Rationale&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">{Reference=LREQ 2}</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;input device interface&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;Requirement&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">{ID=“LREQ 1”, Kind=Safety, OfRequirement=“HREQ 1”, Specification=‘Exists User Confirmation</p><p class="s27">for every Path Change’}</p><p class="s27">SafeFlightPaths</p><p class="s27">1</p><p class="s27">Reads    1</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;Requirement&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">{ID=“LREQ 2”, Kind=Safety, OfRequirement=“HREQ 1”, Specification=‘Chosen Aircraft Flight Path is</p><p class="s27">PilotKeyboardInterface</p><p class="s27">Commands      *</p><p class="s27">1</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;state dependent control&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt;             1</p><p class="s27">{CriticalityLevel=D} AutoPilotController</p><p class="s27">in Safe Flight Paths Set’} Commands</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;coordinator&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;SafetyCritical&gt;&gt; {CriticalityLevel=B}</p><p class="s27">1</p><p class="s27">&lt;&lt;Formalism&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s27">{Kind=Full, Method=Theorem-Proving, FormalismOf=SteerinController}</p><p class="s27">SteeringController</p><h4>Figure 19: Safety-requirements for an aircraft steering system (structure).</h4><p>Finally,  notice  that  the  language  used  in  the  “Specification”  tagged  value  for  the<br/>&lt;&lt;Requirement&gt;&gt;  (5.2.9)  stereotype  is  more  detailed  and  specific  for  low-level<br/>240</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>requirements than for the high-level requirements. In fact, the “Specification” tagged values for the low-level requirements can be written as mathematical expressions.</p><h3>G.4 Multiple-Version Dissimilar Software</h3><p>Multiple-version  dissimilar  software  is  a  common  technical  solution  to  reliability challenges in highly reliable  and  safety-critical  software.  The  example  in Figure  20 shows  three  dissimilar  software  versions  that  function  as  a  radar  filter.  Those  three dissimilar versions are <span class="s43">RadarFilter1</span>, <span class="s43">RadarFilter2</span>, and <span class="s43">RadarFilter3</span>. Each one of them is stereotyped with &lt;&lt;Replicated&gt;&gt; to indicate that it is a dissimilar version for some other class. The “ID” tagged value uniquely identifies the ID of that class within the replication  group  that  is  specified  in  the  “ReplicationGroup”  tagged  value.  In  this example, the replication group is called “RadarFilter”.<br/>Each   version   of   the   radar   filter   logs   its   output   to   <span class="s43">RadarFilterResults</span>. <span class="s43">RadarFilterResults </span>compares all three outputs from <span class="s43">RadarFilter1</span>, <span class="s43">RadarFilter2</span>, and <span class="s43">RadarFilter3</span>, and determines what the accepted value should be and then it updates the  pilot’s  display  accordingly.  Because  of  this  behaviour,  <span class="s43">RadarFilterResults </span>is stereotyped with &lt;&lt;Comparator&gt;&gt; (5.2.32) to indicate that it compares outputs from dissimilar  software  versions.  The  “ReplicationGroup”  tagged  value  identifies  the replication  group  of  the  multiple  version  dissimilar  software.  It  is  equal  to  the “ReplicatedGroup” tagged values of the &lt;&lt;Replicated&gt;&gt; (5.2.31) stereotypes for each of the   replicated   software   versions.   The   “PolicyParameter”   tagged   value   of   the<br/>&lt;&lt;Comparator&gt;&gt;   stereotype   indicates   that   <span class="s43">RadarFilterResults </span>determines   the accepted output based on a majority voting policy. This means that if two of the three replicated classes agree on a value, their output is accepted as the correct one. The “ReplicatedEntity” tagged values of the &lt;&lt;Comparator&gt;&gt; (5.2.32) stereotype identify the classes whose outputs are considered for voting.<br/>Since multiple-version dissimilar software is a reliability-related solution, the diagram was stereotyped with &lt;&lt;ReliabilityContext&gt;&gt; (5.2.2).<br/>241</p><p class="s14">Carleton University, TR SCE-06-19                                                                                                                                   Decermber 2006</p><p>Notice that in this case, the classes stereotyped with &lt;&lt;Replicated&gt;&gt; (5.2.31) depend (navigability of association) on the one stereotyped with &lt;&lt;Comparator&gt;&gt; (5.2.32). This is only because of a design decision in this model where the radar filters are active components  that  read  the  radar  input  and  inform  the  comparator  class  accordingly. However, this will not always be the case. There can be cases where the comparator class depends   on   the   replicated   classes.   Therefore,   stereotypes   &lt;&lt;comparator&gt;&gt;   and<br/>&lt;&lt;replicated&gt;&gt; do not suggest any specific association navigability between stereotyped<br/>classes.<br/><span><IMG width="574" height="227" src="A UML Profile for Developing Airworthiness-Compliant (RTCA DO-178B), Safety-Critical Software/Image_037.png"/></span></p><p class="s55">&lt;&lt;ReliabilityContext&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s55">&lt;&lt;aglorithm&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s55">&lt;&lt;Replicated&gt;&gt; {ID=“0001”, ReplicationGroup=“RadarFilter”}</p><p class="s55">RadarFiter1</p><p class="s55">1</p><p class="s55">&lt;&lt;algorithm&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s55">&lt;&lt;Replicated&gt;&gt; {ID=“0002”, ReplicationGroup=“RadarFilter”}</p><p class="s55">RadarFiter2</p><p class="s55">1</p><p class="s55">Log Result</p><p class="s55">&lt;&lt;algorithm&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s55">&lt;&lt;Replicated&gt;&gt; {ID=“0003”, ReplicationGroup=“RadarFilter”}</p><p class="s55">RadarFiter3</p><p class="s55">1</p><p class="s55">Log Result                                          1</p><p class="s55">&lt;&lt;algorithm&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s55">&lt;&lt;Comparator&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s55">{ReplicationGroup=“RadarFilter”,</p><p class="s55">Log Result</p><p class="s55">1     PolicyParameter=MajorityVoting, ReplicatedEntity=RadarFilter1,</p><p class="s55">ReplicatedEntity=RadarFilter2, ReplicatedEntity=RadarFilter3}</p><p class="s55">1</p><p class="s55">Update Display</p><p class="s55">&lt;&lt;output device interface&gt;&gt;</p><p class="s55">RadarFilterResults              1</p><p class="s55">1           PilotDisplayInterface</p><h4>Figure 20: Multiple-version radar filter system (structure).</h4><h3>G.5 Concurrent Software</h3><p>This example shows concurrent access to the database presented in Figure 19.
