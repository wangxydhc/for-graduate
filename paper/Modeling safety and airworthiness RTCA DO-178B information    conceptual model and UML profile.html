For example, an aircraft must allow the pilot to lift up the landing gears only if it is airborne. If the landing gears were lifted while the aircraft is on ground, then there would be a hazard, which is likely to result in damaging the aircraft and hurting its occupants. A hazard is a state of the system that could ultimately lead to an accident that may result in an injury or loss in human life.<br/>Many standards require that a safety assessment be per- formed when developing or modifying a safety-critical sys- tem.

RTCA DO-178B [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>] is the de facto safety-related standard for developing software in civil and military airborne systems [<span style=" color: #00F;">7</span>]. It provides guidance on how to achieve assurance levels that the software will not impact the continued safe flight of the aircraft. To certify an airborne system, certification authorities require proof that the RTCA DO-178B [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>] stan- dard was adequately followed during system development.<br/>Due to its impact on safety, and the need for safety assess- ments and thorough analysis, developing software for safety- critical systems is more expensive than developing software</p><p class="s9">123</p><p class="s1">338                                                                                                                                                                                                      G.

One of the chal- lenges, besides actually designing and implementing safety requirements allocated to software, is to be able to accurately communicate safety aspects among the different stakehold- ers involved in software development. This has already been documented in [<span style=" color: #00F;">7</span>], where the authors reported on an exten- sive survey focused on DO-178B. That was performed by the NASA Langley Research Center (in collaboration with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)), to identify the challenges in developing software for safety-critical airborne systems. The authors claimed that correctly communicat- ing requirements between different groups of people is the cause for many issues and difficulties encountered during the development and certification of software intensive systems. They classified these difficulties in two major categories: (a) communication difficulties between regulatory people (e.g., certification authorities) and systems people (e.g., systems engineers and safety engineers), and (b) communication dif- ficulties between systems people and software people (e.g., software engineers). The authors also found out that defining requirements is not an easy task—requirements can be com- plex and are usually inter dependent. This certainly makes it even more difficult for different groups of people to com- municate requirements accurately and effectively. For exam- ple, safety engineers, who rarely are software engineers, may define safety requirements that software engineers find infea- sible or expensive to implement. Further, software engineers may sometimes misinterpret the requirements due to their lack of experience in safety engineering and the application domain. However, if  software engineers better understand the needs behind the requirements, then they may be able to propose solutions that are more practical and cost effective.<br/>In this paper, we report on an approach to address these communication challenges in the context of DO-178B [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>]. This approach is an open framework that may be tailored to other industries, standards, organizations, and projects. In addition, we show how it helps verify and illustrate that the DO-178B [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>] standard was followed in the development process to support system certification.<br/>The Unified Modeling Language (UML) [<span style=" color: #00F;">27</span>, <span style=" color: #00F;">28</span>] is now the de facto standard for modeling (object-oriented) software [<span style=" color: #00F;">29</span>], and is increasingly used in the aerospace industry (e.g., [<span style=" color: #00F;">1</span>, <span style=" color: #00F;">5</span>, <span style=" color: #00F;">8</span>, <span style=" color: #00F;">19</span>, <span style=" color: #00F;">21</span>]). Therefore, we aim at extending the UML notation with concepts inspired from DO-178B by defining a new profile that we call SafeUML. Because we focus on soft- ware for airborne systems in this research, the DO-178B stan- dard [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>] is analyzed to extract a list of key concepts that are of interest to both safety engineers, software engineers, and certification authorities. We show that if those concepts are properly represented in UML models of software, then soft- ware engineers can more formally document safety-relevant and certification-relevant information and decisions. A tool<br/>can then automatically generate reports containing safety and certification information to be used within the context of DO-<br/>178B [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>]. This provides safety engineers with better insight into the software compliance with safety and certification requirements, which they can easily track during the software development life cycle. Those reports could also be used for safety cases and/or evidence of software compliance with the safety requirements, which can then be presented to external certification authorities. Using a UML profile is expected to increase the software engineers’ awareness of safety-related issues, which should enable them to better develop software for safety-critical systems, have a higher confidence in the developed  software,  better communicate with safety engi- neers, and provide proof that they followed safety-related standard  requirements. Following a process similar to the two-staged approach proposed in [<span style=" color: #00F;">15</span>], we define a concep- tual model for our UML profile, explaining each concept, its attributes, and its relationships with other concepts. This approach mirrors the one used by the Object Management Group (OMG) to define its profiles such as Quality of Ser- vice (QoS) for high-quality and Fault-Tolerant (FT) systems [<span style=" color: #00F;">25</span>], Schedulability, Performance, and Time (SPT) [<span style=" color: #00F;">23</span>], and Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time Embedded (MARTE) systems [<span style=" color: #00F;">26</span>]. Based on the conceptual model requirements, we design a UML profile, with stereotypes and their attributes (tagged values), to model safety and certification information in the context of DO-178B [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>]. We focus on class diagrams because they are the most commonly used diagram type, but future work will tailor the proposed  stereotypes and their attributes to other diagrams such as sequence diagrams and state machines.<br/>In an earlier paper [<span style=" color: #00F;">34</span>], we explained the need for a UML profile for software development in the context of DO-178B [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>], and then presented design examples that were modeled using our SafeUML profile. We now introduce the conceptual model of this UML profile in detail, explaining and justifying all the concepts, and then define the attributes of each concept as well as the relationships between the concepts. According to Lagarde et al. [<span style=" color: #00F;">15</span>], the conceptual model is a key element in the design of UML profiles. Several UML profile designs can satisfy any given conceptual model, and we provide one carefully thought out design in this paper. In addition, we show how the SafeUML profile can help the development of software for safety-critical systems using DO-178B guide- lines. For example, we discuss how certification information can be generated from models based on SafeUML to support various activities of safety engineers, software engineers, and certification authorities.<br/>The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. We discuss system safety and  certification per  DO-178B in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">2</span>. In Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">3</span>, we discuss the requirements that a UML profile should have to adequately facilitate the definition and use of safety information in software models within the</p><p class="s9">123</p><p class="s1">Modeling safety and airworthiness information                                                                                                                                                      339</p><p><span><IMG width="652" height="1" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_004.png"/></span><br/>context of DO-178B, and then we identify and evaluate exist- ing UML-based techniques for safety-critical systems in light of these requirements. We then present and explain our con- ceptual model in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">4</span>, and present the SafeUML profile in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">5</span>, while continuously validating the results with respect to development and certification per the DO-178B standard. A case study  in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">6 </span>presents a number of illustrating examples that show how SafeUML helps address DO-178B certification and communication challenges reported in [<span style=" color: #00F;">7</span>]. Conclusions are drawn in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">7</span>.</p><h2>2 System safety and certification per DO-178B</h2><p>In this section, we first present a short introduction to DO-<br/>178B (Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">2.1</span>). We then present, based on the communica- tion challenges reported in [<span style=" color: #00F;">7</span>] and our own experience, how safety information is communicated between different stake- holders involved in the development of software-intensive systems (Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">2.2</span>). Then, we argue that embedding safety information into software engineering UML models facili- tates the exchange of safety information between safety and software engineers (Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">2.3</span>).<br/>2.1 Introduction to DO-178B<br/>Many industrial standards exist to help develop safety-critical systems. Herrmann summarizes them in [<span style=" color: #00F;">9</span>], and we discuss many of them in [<span style=" color: #00F;">33</span>]. Generally speaking, some standards are common to all industry sectors (e.g., IEC 61508-3 [<span style=" color: #00F;">13</span>]) whereas others are industry specific (e.g., CENELEC 50128 for Railway applications [<span style=" color: #00F;">2</span>]). Within the aerospace industry, there are various safety-related standards owned by different bodies such as the Radio Technical Commission for Aeronau- tics (RTCA), European Space Agency (ESA), National Aero- nautics and Space Administration (NASA), and American Institute  of  Aeronautics  and  Astronautics  (AIAA).  Our research scope primarily focused on airworthiness, and there- fore our choice of standard was RTCA DO-178B [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>] because it is the de facto safety-related standard for developing soft- ware aspects of aerospace systems [<span style=" color: #00F;">7</span>]. This quality standard outlines requirements on many aspects of software develop- ment for airborne systems.<br/>The DO-178B’s requirements focus on the impact of soft- ware failure on safety, i.e., how critical is the failure of each component and what does that mean for the system safety as a whole. This impact is classified into five categories, namely: <i>Catastrophic</i>, <i>Hazardous/Severe-Major</i>, <i>Major</i>, <i>Minor</i>, and <i>No Effect</i>. Different certification or assurance levels exist for each failure category, namely, level A, level B, level C, level D and level E, respectively. Level A certification is the most rigorous and requires the submission of the largest number of documents and proof of compliance with DO-178B. Level<br/>B is less rigid, followed by level C and then level D. Level E indicates that there is <i>No Effect </i>on flight safety and DO-178B requirements do not apply to it. As a result, the higher the certification level pursued, the more expensive it is to develop software in order to ensure higher confidence in the software quality and system safety.<br/>The DO-178B standard defines failure condition catego- ries and software levels based on the “severity of failure con- ditions on the aircraft and its occupants” [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>]. This focuses on the aircraft’s ability to undertake safe flights and excludes the safety impact on the environment outside the aircraft. The term “airworthiness” is therefore used, and indicates whether an aircraft is worthy of a safe flight. This is more specific than Leveson’s definition of safety, which was stated as “the freedom from accidents or losses” [<span style=" color: #00F;">16</span>] without restriction to where the accidents or losses occur—even if they are outside the aircraft. Therefore, there exists a difference between the concepts of “airworthiness” and “safety”. Airworthiness is concerned with accidents or losses on the <i>aircraft and its occupants </i>and is therefore a subset of safety: a safe system is airworthy but an airworthy system is not necessarily safe.<br/>DO-178B requirements on software aspects of system cer- tification include:</p><p class="s4">•  <span class="p">Objectives of software life cycle processes;</span></p><p class="s4">•  <span class="p">Design and activity considerations to achieve those pro- cess objectives;</span></p><p class="s4">•  <span class="p">Evidence consideration to prove that those process objec- tives are satisfied.</span></p><p>Examples of the DO-178B objectives and considerations include:</p><p class="s4">•  <span class="p">Traceability of requirements for instance through design elements, implementation code, and object code (e.g., executable file generated by compiler).

One study found out that communication challenges are the root cause of many problems [<span style=" color: #00F;">7</span>]. Another one found out that this is mostly  document-based, and such documentation tends to become large, ambiguous, inconsistent, and often lack clear</p><p class="s9">123</p><p class="s1">340                                                                                                                                                                                                      G. Zoughbi et al.</p><p><span><IMG width="652" height="1" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_005.png"/></span><br/>structure [<span style=" color: #00F;">17</span>]. A third one found out that limited communi- cation channels and poor information flow can prevent safety engineers from interacting with software engineers to ensure system safety [<span style=" color: #00F;">16</span>].<br/>The  National  Aeronautics  and  Space  Administration (NASA) Langley Research Center has long cooperated with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on research about software engineering methods for aerospace applications. They  conducted a  research program called Streamlining Software Aspects of Certification (SSAC), which included an extensive survey that identified the challenges in devel- oping safety-critical software for aerospace systems using DO-178B.  The  research  found  out  that  communication between different groups of people was the root cause of many  common challenges in safety [<span style=" color: #00F;">7</span>]. The authors clas- sified those communication challenges into two categories, between  regulatory/certification authorities  and  systems/ safety engineers, and between systems/safety engineers and software engineers. Those findings are consistent with our own experience.<br/>To understand and present the challenges, we analyzed what activities are performed by different stakeholders of the software development of safety-critical systems. We found that those activities concerned the storage, retrieval or anal- ysis  of  safety-relevant information, which is continuously communicated across different stakeholder groups with dif- ferent experience and skill sets. The use case diagram in Fig. <span style=" color: #00F;">1 </span>summarizes these results, which we describe below:<br/>Usage 1 <i>Provide Safety Requirements</i>: Safety engineers perform a safety assessment of the system being developed. This results in safety requirements for the system, a subset of which is allocated to soft- ware and communicated to software engineers;<br/>Usage 2  <i>Embed Safety Requirements in the Design Phase of Software System Development</i>: Software engi- neers  design the software system per the safety requirements allocated to software;<br/>Usage 3 <i>Record and Justify Design Decisions</i>: Software engineers record and justify their design decisions. Traditionally, architectural and major design deci- sions have been recorded in documents separate from the software model and detailed design deci- sions often appear as plain text comments in the source code, if at all. In practice, this makes it hard to ensure this information is systematically and precisely collected and documented and to auto- matically retrieve justifications for design deci- sions;<br/>Usage 4 <i>Monitor  Safety</i>:  Safety  engineers  continuously monitor the software system development activ- ities with regards to the safety requirements they provided (Usage 1) during the software develop-<br/>ment lifecycle. To do so, they need to investi- gate how software engineers design the software (Usage 2), and  why it is effective (Usage 3) to address the safety requirements they were pro- vided with (Usage 1). Safety engineers can then analyze this information and discuss any issues with software engineers, thus ensuring that system safety is continuously improving during the devel- opment lifecycle so that it meets its final safety objectives;<br/>Usage 5 <i>Get Safety Information</i>: Safety-relevant informa- tion, such as DO-178B-relevant information, is submitted to the appropriate authorities for cer- tification, which usually occurs towards the end of the system development lifecycle. This infor- mation includes the safety requirements (Usage<br/>1), the software design (Usage 2), the justification of the software design (Usage 3) given the safety requirements of the software (Usage 1), and the process used to continuously monitor the system safety during the development lifecycle (Usage 4).<br/>2.3 A case for a UML-based communication between stakeholders<br/>The authors of [<span style=" color: #00F;">17</span>] discuss the benefits of modeling informa- tion for safety-case development, including leveraging mod- eling tool features such as model validation and querying of models to retrieve safety-relevant information. In our work, the basic assumption is that our Usage scenarios (Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">2.2</span>) would be greatly facilitated if relevant safety information were captured  and integrated in design models already in use for development. In other words, such augmented design model could play a central role in the precise communica- tion of safety-related information across stakeholders. Soft- ware engineers could thus record such information in models, safety engineers could monitor it by querying the models for relevant safety information using appropriate tools, and certi- fication authorities could get reports directly generated from the models as Fig. <span style=" color: #00F;">2 </span>illustrates.<br/>Our work proposes to express these models using an exten- sion (profile) of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) that we  specifically define to address the needs of DO-178B. Languages other than UML could have been considered for this work. However, there are many benefits [<span style=" color: #00F;">33</span>] justifying the use of UML, a common standard for modeling software, including:<br/>1.   Many development environments and  methodologies support the use of UML;<br/>2.   It is possible to extend the UML language while being able to use existing modeling environments.

Knowledge of UML is also required for the OMG recommended, Model-Driven Architecture (MDA), which is popular in the develop- ment of airborne systems (e.g., [<span style=" color: #00F;">1</span>, <span style=" color: #00F;">5</span>, <span style=" color: #00F;">8</span>, <span style=" color: #00F;">19</span>, <span style=" color: #00F;">21</span>]).<br/>While modeling requires knowledge of UML, generating and understanding safety reports from the model does not. This is because any tool that extracts information by querying the model can present the information in a model-independent format. This means that monitoring safety and certifying the system can be performed in a UML-independent manner, and hence  relieving safety engineers and certification authori- ties from having to understand UML terminology. Gener- ated reports  would be produced in a format that properly enables safety monitoring (Usage 4) and submission of rele- vant information (e.g., in DO-178B specific terminology) to the certification authorities (Usage 5).<br/>To illustrate this further, Table <span style=" color: #00F;">1 </span>explains how our usage scenarios and SafeUML integrate into and apply to each typ- ical system and software development process phase.<br/>UML  is  now  a  mature  standard and,  therefore, it  is supported by a wide variety of tools. In fact, many UML tool vendors are OMG members, and therefore participate in maintaining the UML standard and its related profiles. Exam- ples  of  popular UML  tools  that  can  be  used  to  utilize SafeUML in the development process are: IBM Rational<br/>Rhapsody [<span style=" color: #00F;">10</span>], IBM Rational Software Architect [<span style=" color: #00F;">11</span>], ARTi- SAN Studio [<span style=" color: #00F;">12</span>], and Sparx Systems Enterprise Architect [<span style=" color: #00F;">31</span>]. IBM, ARTiSAN, and Sparx Systems are all OMG mem- bers.<br/>The key features required out of those UML tools are the ability to define SafeUML as a custom profile, the ability to model the system and software using SafeUML, and the abil- ity to query those SafeUML models according to the needs of the safety engineers and certification authorities. Some of the options available to query UML models and generate reports are:</p><p class="s4">•  <span class="p">Standard tool reporting facilities that are built in the UML modeling tool. For example, tools generally allow search- ing UML models for locations where a specific stereotype is used;</span></p><p><span class="s4">•  </span>Custom, user-defined, reporting capabilities. Tools gener- ally allow modelers to define their own custom reporting mechanisms. For example, modelers can specify model queries interpreted by query engines based on the Object Constraint Language (OCL) [<span style=" color: #00F;">22</span>] such as  the Model Development  Tools  (MDT)-OCL engine  working  on Ecore models in the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) [<span style=" color: #00F;">3</span>]. As another example, IBM Rhapsody [<span style=" color: #00F;">10</span>] provides a Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) library that can be used in VBA scripts to navigate models and perform model validation and generate custom reports as neces- sary.  Sparx  Systems  Enterprise  Architect  [<span style=" color: #00F;">31</span>]  also supports scripting capabilities  through an Automation Interface to navigate UML models. Model validation can be used to check model compliance with safety best prac- tices thus warning safety engineers and software engi- neers about safety risks;<br/><span class="s4">•  </span>Exporting    UML    models    using    XML    Metadata Interchange (XMI) [<span style=" color: #00F;">24</span>], which is an OMG standard for representing and exchanging models and metadata in an XML-based  language.  UML  tools  generally  support exporting UML models as XMI files. Once exported, it can be easily parsed and searched, potentially using the Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) [<span style=" color: #00F;">32</span>] and a sup- porting engine.</p><p class="s9">123</p><p class="s1">342                                                                                                                                                                                                      G.

Safety analysis aims at identifying safety hazards through the application of various methods [16], e.g., an aircraft’s pilot attempts to lift the landing gear when the aircraft is on the ground. By the end of this phase, safety hazards are identified and analysed by safety engineers.</p><p class="s1">Requirements specification                              During the Requirements Specification phase, which typically includes specifying the system requirements as analysed, the set of safety requirements are identified. Safety requirements aim to mitigate the safety hazards identified in the Analysis phase, e.g., the system shall not lift the landing gear if the aircraft is on the ground even if the pilot requests so. This requirement is said to be allocated to software if it is to be implemented in software. By the end of this phase, safety requirements are specified and a subset of them is allocated to software. Safety engineers then perform Usage scenario 1 (Provide Safety Requirements) to software engineers.</p><p class="s1">Architecture                                                      During the Architecture phase, the system and software architecture is further defined in a UML model utilizing SafeUML. SafeUML stereotypes and their attributes are used by software engineers to document safety requirements in the model and to relate them to specific software elements. They also explain their architectural decisions based on safety requirements, e.g., why and how partitions were set, in the model. In essence, they perform a high-level Usage scenario 2 (Embed Safety Requirements in the Design Phase of Software System Development) and Usage scenario 3 (Record and Justify Design Decisions). Safety engineers now start performing Usage scenario 4 (Monitor Safety) by querying the UML model using the same modeling tool used by the software engineers. Based on such information, they can understand the status of the software development progress with respect to designing the safety requirements into the system.</p><p class="s1">Design                                                               During the Design phase, the software system is further designed with additional details at the subsystem, component, and class levels. Software engineers apply Usage scenario 2 and Usage scenario 3 as in the Architecture phase. Here, they are likely to use a larger set of SafeUML stereotypes than in the Architecture phase because many stereotypes are able to capture detailed design decisions and their justifications as illustrated later in this paper. Safety engineers are also involved in Usage scenario 4 to keep monitoring the design of system safety requirements in software.</p><p class="s1">Implementation                                                 During the Implementation phase, the software system’s design, modeled using SafeUML is implemented by writing the source code. The code is directly traceable to the design and hence to safety requirements. Thus, safety engineers can continue to monitor system safety (Usage scenario 4) by extracting safety information from the UML model, similarly to the Design phase. At this stage, however, they will get additional information regarding whether safety</p><p class="s1">requirements are actually implemented or are still in the design phase, and which part(s) of the code implement which safety requirement.</p><p class="s1">Test and integration                                          During the test and integration phase, the coded system is tested and integrated per its specified requirements. The requirements also include the safety requirements, which were communicated by the Safety engineers (Usage scenario 1). Software engineers can verify the design and implementation compliance to these safety requirements and constraints that are traced to the UML model elements using SafeUML stereotypes, e.g., timing constraints for real-time systems and/or active objects. Safety engineers continue to monitor safety (Usage scenario 4) and can now tell which safety requirements are tested and integrated. During this phase, preparation for certification is already ongoing and the UML models would have sufficient safety information to generate customized reports for the certification authorities (Usage scenario 5).</p><p class="s1">Operation and maintenance                              During the operation and maintenance phase, the software system is functional and operating in its target environment. As part of maintenance, it may be modified to fix any identified bugs or as a result of functional change requests. Before changing software, safety engineers may query the UML model (Usage scenario 4) to assess the impact of change on system safety since safety requirements are documented (Usage scenario 2) as are design decisions (Usage scenario 3). By now, design and code changes are directly traceable to model elements that include safety information as a result of using SafeUML.</p><p><span><IMG width="662" height="1" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_012.png"/></span><br/>Here is a summary of the practical benefits we expect for each usage scenario in Fig. <span style=" color: #00F;">1</span>, which will become clearer when going through our case study in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">6</span>:</p><p class="s4">•  <span class="p">Safety  engineers  will  better  communicate  require- ments to software engineers (Usage 1).

Then, we present existing UML-based solutions that allow modeling safety aspects and discuss their evaluation with respect to the infor- mation requirements (Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">3.2</span>).<br/>3.1 Safety-related information requirements<br/>We performed a careful analysis of the DO-178B [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>] stan- dard, which led us to identify relevant DO-178B-related con- cepts.  A suitable UML-based solution should be able to model those concepts. Since airworthiness is a subset of safety (see Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">2</span>), all of the airworthiness-related concepts we identified are also safety-related concepts and are referred to as such in the remainder of this document.<br/>A careful analysis of the DO-178B [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>] standard led us to identify safety-related concepts that were found relevant to consider when developing software for airborne systems. Such concepts are not all directly related to safety, hence the use of the term “safety-related concepts” rather than simply “safety concepts”. Examples include concepts related to reli- ability (e.g., fault-tolerance), performance, and certification. Those safety-related concepts were refined into a smaller set of safety-related concepts that capture the same informa- tion in a more concise manner. Though this is discussed in detail in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">4.1</span>, it should be noted that those refined con- cepts became the basis for the information requirements that a suitable UML-based solution must satisfy. The safety-related concepts and conceptual model are presented in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">4.2 </span>and Appendix <span style=" color: #00F;">A</span>.<br/>Based on the safety-related concepts, we carefully pro- duced 54 information requirements that identified the infor- mation that a suitable solution must be able to model in UML. Therefore, they became the basis upon which solutions to model safety-related concepts in UML were assessed. Com- plete information requirements are found in [<span style=" color: #00F;">33</span>] and exam- ples are provided below:<br/>IREQ 1 The solution shall be able to identify a safety- related context under which safety information, possibly specified through other means, is valid;<br/>IREQ 9 The solution shall be able to specify software requirements, including safety-related and certi- fication-related requirements;<br/>IREQ 11 The solution shall be able to model a software model’s deviation from a plan, requirement, or a standard;<br/>IREQ 12 The solution shall be able to model specific soft- ware implementation styles of interest to DO-<br/>178B-related software such as recursion, dynamic memory, compacted expressions, and data aliases;<br/>IREQ 15 The solution shall be able to model COTS soft- ware, including the rationale for using it;<br/>IREQ 20 The  solution  shall  be  able  to  model  software events;<br/>IREQ 21 The solution shall be able to specify how a partic- ular event affects system safety;<br/>IREQ 22 The solution shall be able to model software reac- tions, or responses, to software events;<br/>IREQ 25 The solution shall be able to model safety-critical elements;<br/>IREQ 26 The solution shall be able to specify the criticality level of safety-critical elements, or the element’s contributions to failure conditions;<br/>IREQ 27 The solution shall be able to model a software par- tition;<br/>IREQ 30 The solution shall be able to model safety moni- toring software;<br/>IREQ 39 The solution shall be able to model hardware/soft- ware interfaces;<br/>IREQ 52 The solution shall be able to model multiple- version dissimilar software;<br/>IREQ 53 The solution shall be able to model software com- parators, or voters, for multiple version dissimilar software;<br/>IREQ 54 The solution shall be able to specify the voting pol- icy parameters for software comparators or voters.<br/>3.2 Existing UML-based solutions<br/>There exist several UML-based solutions that may capture safety-related information in UML models.</p><p class="s9">123</p><p class="s1">344                                                                                                                                                                                                      G. Zoughbi et al.</p><p><span><IMG width="652" height="1" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_014.png"/></span><br/>The Object Management Group (OMG) adopted a pro- file to model Quality of Service (QoS) for high-quality and Fault-Tolerant (FT) systems [<span style=" color: #00F;">25</span>]. It includes frameworks to describe quality of service, risk assessment, and fault tol- erance. The quality of service part can be used to model safety. The risk assessment part provides mechanisms for modeling risk contexts, stakeholders, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, unwanted incidents, risk quantifi- cation, risk mitigation and treatments. The fault tolerance part includes mechanisms for describing fault-tolerant software architectures in general as a technical solution to reliability requirements, and focuses on modeling software redundancy, or software replication.<br/>The Schedulability, Performance, and Time (SPT) profile [<span style=" color: #00F;">23</span>], which provides mechanisms to model concepts of importance to real-time systems was also adopted by the OMG. It includes frameworks to model resources, time, concurrency, schedulability, and performance, and allows developers to perform model-based performance analysis. However, safety is not its primary focus. More recently, OMG adopted the Modeling and Analysis of Real-Time Embedded (MARTE) systems profile [<span style=" color: #00F;">26</span>]. The MARTE profile super- sedes the SPT profile, but SPT was the official UML profile for schedulability, performance, and time when this research was performed and hence we used the SPT profile in our evaluation.<br/>The  High Integrity Distributed Object-Oriented Real- Time Systems (HIDOORS) was a European project [<span style=" color: #00F;">18</span>]. One  of its goals was to introduce SPT profile-compliant mechanisms for modeling safety-critical and embedded real- time applications. Although aimed at safety-critical applica- tions, it specialized SPT concepts such as triggers, actions, resources, and scheduling jobs by focusing on concurrency, performance, and schedulability. However, it did not spe- cifically focus on safety—the freedom from accidents and losses.<br/>Jan Jürjens presented a UML profile [<span style=" color: #00F;">14</span>] that aimed at modeling reliability aspects regarding transmitting messages (e.g., maximum failure rates for message communication). Jürjens argued that since failures related to lost, delayed, or corrupted messages have an impact on safety in safety-critical applications, the profile can be used for developing safety- critical applications. It included mechanisms to model risks, crashes, guarantees, redundancy, safe links, safe dependen- cies, safety critical elements, safe behaviors, containment, and error handling.<br/>Based  on  the  IEC  61508  standard [<span style=" color: #00F;">13</span>],  Hansen and Gullesen presented a series of UML patterns that can be used to model some aspects of safety-critical systems [<span style=" color: #00F;">6</span>]. The pat- terns allowed modeling the safety quality of service, software diversity and voting, partial diversity with built-in diagnostic or monitoring, “safe” communication protocols, testing, haz- ard analysis and quality development. They include mecha-<br/>nisms to model, in use cases, redundancy, monitoring, and voting based on multiple output comparisons.<br/>We evaluated how the UML-based solutions discussed above score with respect to satisfying the information require- ments  discussed in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">3.1</span>—the full list of information requirements is available in [<span style=" color: #00F;">33</span>]. Each profile’s score was calculated based on how many information requirements it met. We observed (see details in [<span style=" color: #00F;">33</span>]) that none of the exist- ing solutions that we evaluated achieved more than 31% of the maximum score. In fact, all of the solutions combined only met 44% of the information requirements. For instance: events and reactions can be modeled in HIDOORS [<span style=" color: #00F;">18</span>] and SPT [<span style=" color: #00F;">23</span>], but not in the other three solutions; monitors can only be modeled in [<span style=" color: #00F;">14</span>, <span style=" color: #00F;">23</span>]; a model element’s contribution to failure conditions (i.e., criticality levels in the DO-178B standard) is only handled in [<span style=" color: #00F;">6</span>, <span style=" color: #00F;">14</span>, <span style=" color: #00F;">23</span>]; the implementation style (e.g., recursion, dynamic  memory allocation), hard- ware/software interfaces, and configurable components can- not be modeled by any of the existing solutions, and those are all information requirements that were identified in [<span style=" color: #00F;">33</span>]. Therefore, we decided to develop our own UML profile, Saf- eUML, as a solution for airworthiness.</p><h2>4 Safety-related conceptual model for airborne systems</h2><p>In this section, we present the conceptual model SafeUML uses to describe software considerations for airborne sys- tems. We first describe the process we followed (Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">4.1</span>) and then the conceptual model we defined (Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">4.2</span>). The conceptual model is a general data model for information needed to develop software in compliance with the DO-178B standard [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>], and it can be reused in approaches other than a UML profile, e.g., DOORS or Oracle databases.<br/>4.1 Design process<br/>Our conceptual model design approach is consistent with the approach devised by Lagarde et al. [<span style=" color: #00F;">15</span>]. Consistent with step<br/>1 of their process, we reviewed the DO-178B standard [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>] and identified the raw list of concepts (see Section 3.1 in [<span style=" color: #00F;">33</span>] for further details). Consistent with step 2 of their process, we refined the concepts by reducing the problem space—we removed irrelevant concepts and redundancies, as detailed in [<span style=" color: #00F;">33</span>]. Consistent with step 4 of their process, we also went through an iterative optimization process to:<br/>1.   Remove duplicate concepts: Seemingly different con- cepts sometimes appear in the DO-178B standard where, in  reality, they represent the same idea. For instance, <i>multiple-version dissimilar software </i>and <i>software redun- dancy </i>describe the same idea of using multiple software components that have the same functionality but differ- ent implementations;</p><p class="s9">123</p><p class="s1">Modeling safety and airworthiness information                                                                                                                                                      345</p><p><span><IMG width="652" height="1" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_015.png"/></span><br/>2.   Group concepts: Some concepts are in fact examples of a more general concept. For instance, <i>safety monitoring</i>, <i>fault detection</i>, <i>integrity check </i>are applications of a sin- gle concept that is “monitor”, which monitors the activity of other components to detect unusual, potentially haz- ardous, events or behaviors. Thus, they are grouped as a single concept, and they are differentiated via attributes, e.g., a “monitor” concept with a “kind” attribute that is “safety” for <i>safety monitoring</i>, “reliability” for <i>fault detection</i>, and “integrity” for <i>integrity check</i>;<br/>3.   Precisely define concepts: We elaborated and clearly defined each concept, with attributes each describing a single aspect of the concept. For instance, when defin- ing the “requirement” concept, we give it an attribute called “specification” that can be used to specify what the requirement is, e.g., “Speed &gt; 20 m/s”) We use a consis- tent    approach    for    concept    definition,    adapting approaches used in existing UML profiles (e.g., [<span style=" color: #00F;">23</span>, <span style=" color: #00F;">25</span>,</p><p class="s6">26<span style=" color: #131413;">]). For each concept, we provide: concept definition, attribute definition, relations to other concepts, and ref- erence to the original DO-178B concept(s).</span></p><p>This activity resulted in the definition of 26 safety-related concepts, 48 attributes, and 35 inter-concept relationships. Their  various combinations can represent all of the origi- nal safety-related concepts obtained from DO-178B, and sat- isfy all information requirements. These refined concepts and their relationships were defined and then grouped according to their purpose, and finally formalized under the form of a conceptual model represented as a UML class diagram.<br/>4.2 Conceptual model<br/>The refined concepts were grouped into five different cat- egories depending on their purpose. The categories were determined after an analysis of all final concepts obtained as described in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">4.1</span>:<br/>1.   <i>Requirements</i>: This category contains concepts to model requirements, deviation from requirements, implemen- tation styles, behavioral styles, source of the design (e.g., COTS,  previously  developed,  …  etc),  requirements traceability  through design and code, and partitioning decisions;<br/>2.   <i>Characteristics: </i>This category contains concepts to des- ignate safety-critical elements and identify their soft- ware  levels or failure condition categories, simulators to model elements, design strategies (e.g., round-robin, FIFO, … etc), measures such as complexity and cou- pling, and hardware/software interfaces;<br/>3.   <i>Event Management: </i>This category contains concepts to model events and actions that may impact system safety, responses to such events or actions, where they are<br/>detected, and where they are handled to ensure safety. It also includes concepts to designate inputs defended against  using  defensive  programming  and  identifies active and passive elements;<br/>4.   <i>Configuration: </i>This category contains concepts to model software configurations and user-modifiable software, including which design elements are configurable, which ones can be loaded on platforms to change configura- tions, and where in the design such changes are initiated and controlled;<br/>5.   <i>Replication: </i>This category contains concepts to model software redundancy, e.g., using multiple-version dis- similar software, and allowing the modeler to designate redundant elements and voting elements.<br/>Each concept, along with its attributes and its relationships to other concepts, are discussed in detail in Appendix <span style=" color: #00F;">A</span>. How- ever, we concisely introduce each concept in Table <span style=" color: #00F;">2</span>: they are all numbered C1 to C26. The conceptual model, i.e., the concepts, their relationships and the five groups discussed above, is represented as a class diagram (with components for the groups), as illustrated in Fig. <span style=" color: #00F;">3</span>.<br/>Table <span style=" color: #00F;">3 </span>identifies examples of the original DO-178B [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>] concepts, the  DO-178B Section numbers in  which they appear, and where such information is captured in our con- ceptual model. This validates that our conceptual model is in fact designed to model concepts relevant to DO-178B [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>].</p><h2>5 SafeUML: safety-related UML profile for airborne systems</h2><p>This section introduces SafeUML, a UML profile that sat- isfies the information requirements discussed in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">3.1</span>, and  which is based on the conceptual model described in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">4.2</span>. Since we did not find an existing UML solution that met more than one third of the information requirements [<span style=" color: #00F;">33</span>], we proceed by designing one, specifically a UML pro- file, to satisfy all of them (Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">5.1</span>). The UML profile we design, called SafeUML, may be seen as one possible imple- mentation of the defined conceptual model according to the process described in [<span style=" color: #00F;">15</span>]. In Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">5.2</span>, we present the value of the profile in the context of DO-178B [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>], and in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">5.3 </span>we discuss SafeUML’s applicability to other standards.<br/>5.1 Profile design<br/>SafeUML, which implements the conceptual model pre- sented in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">4.2</span>, resulted in 31 stereotypes with 79 stereo- type attributes. We explained in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">1 </span>that we first focused on class diagrams because they are the most commonly used diagram type. Stereotypes and their associated attributes will apply to several meta-model elements of the class diagram including classes, operations, and relationships, but also to</p><p class="s9">123</p><p class="s1">346                                                                                                                                                                                                      G.

For example the level of safety-critical model elements can depend on the applicable safety-related standard. The DO-178B standard [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>] uses (A, B, C, D, E) whereas IEC 61508 [<span style=" color: #00F;">13</span>] uses (SIL1, SIL2, SIL3, SIL4). That is why class <span class="s11">SafetyLevel </span>has two possible sub-classes, one for each standard. We provided this example to illustrate that  additional enumerations can be added by introducing new subclasses for project-specific requirements.<br/>Recall  that  our  profile design  is  consistent  with  the approach devised by Lagarde et al. [<span style=" color: #00F;">15</span>]. Per steps 3 and<br/>4 of their process, we transformed the conceptual model elements into potential stereotypes. Each stereotype inher- its from UML meta-classes to indicate which kinds of model elements it can be applied on (<span class="s11">Package</span>, <span class="s11">Class</span>, <span class="s11">Oper- ation</span>, <span class="s11">Relationship</span>). Then, the resulting stereotypes were optimized to remove relationships that violated meta- relationships in the UML meta-model among the four base classes  listed  above  (<span class="s11">Package</span>,  <span class="s11">Class</span>,  <span class="s11">Operation</span>, <span class="s11">Relationship</span>), and the relationships were replaced with attributes. As a consequence, some concept relations (from Fig. <span style=" color: #00F;">3</span>), and therefore stereotypes relations, do not explicitly appear in the packages. For instance, a <span class="s11">Reaction </span>(C.15) reacts to an <span class="s11">Event </span>(C.14) (or another reaction) and there is a relationship between them in the conceptual model. However, there is no association  between  stereotype <span class="s11">«Reaction» (S.22) </span>and stereotype <span class="s11">«Event» (S.21) </span>(Fig. <span style=" color: #00F;">9</span>) since there is no association between the meta-classes those two stereotypes inherit from in the UML 2.0 metamodel. Instead,<br/>there  is  an  attribute  <span class="s11">consequenceOf </span>in  stereotype</p><p class="s11">«Reaction» (S.22) <span class="p">that lists the event names (or reac- tion names) that </span>Reaction (S.22) <span class="p">reacts to. Hence, SafeUML remains consistent with the UML meta-model.</span></p><p>The model can be queried through OCL [<span style=" color: #00F;">22</span>] expressions using one of the existing OCL [<span style=" color: #00F;">22</span>] engines, for example the MDT-OCL engine working on the Ecore models in the EMF framework [<span style=" color: #00F;">3</span>]. For instance, a <span class="s11">«Reaction» (S.22) </span>is a <span class="s11">Class </span>or <span class="s11">Operation </span>that implements a reaction ste- reotyped with <span class="s11">«Event» (S.21) </span>(or its subclass <span class="s11">«Reac- tion» (S.22)</span>), and this is modeled using the <span class="s11">conse- quenceOf </span>attribute value in the SafeUML profile. This information can be retrieved by executing the following OCL query, in the context of <span class="s11">Reaction (S.22)</span>, on an instance model of the SafeUML profile:</p><p class="s11">self<span class="s12">.</span>consequenceOf<span class="s4">− </span><span class="s12">&gt; </span>forAll<span class="s12">(</span>s <span class="s4">: </span>String<span class="s4">| </span>Event<span class="s12">.</span>allInstances<span class="s4">− </span><span class="s12">&gt; </span>including<span class="s12">(</span>Reaction<span class="s12">.</span>allInstances<span class="s12">)</span><span class="s4">− </span><span class="s12">&gt; </span>exists<span class="s12">(</span>name <span class="s4">= </span>s<span class="s12">))</span></p><p>5.2 Value of information captured by SafeUML<br/>This section discusses the value of information that can be generated from SafeUML models as related to the usage sce- narios defined in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">2.2 </span>for safety engineers, certification authorities, and software engineers.

These concepts were identified and captured in a conceptual model (see Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">4.2</span>, which includes a mapping from  the conceptual model to the original DO-178B con- cepts). In turn, the conceptual model was then implemented by the SafeUML profile (see Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">5.1</span>, which includes a map- ping from each SafeUML stereotype to the corresponding concept from the conceptual model). It then follows that Saf- eUML captures all DO-178B-relevant information.<br/>Usage 1–Usage 3 illustrate that safety-related informa- tion is communicated and documented. Next, Usage 4 illus-<br/>trates the need for continuous monitoring of safety and cer- tification aspects during the development life cycle: Usages<br/>1-3 are prerequisites to Usage 4. Critical to this is achieving effective communication between safety engineers and soft- ware engineers. Since SafeUML captures DO-178B-relevant information, SafeUML models can be used as a repository for these two groups to exchange precise, unambiguous infor- mation regarding software-based system safety. By simply performing  their  regular design modeling duties, software engineers will collect and formulate safety and certification information in their designs. Once captured by the modeling tool, this information can be easily generated anytime during</p><p class="s9">123</p><p class="s1">Modeling safety and airworthiness information                                                                                                                                                      349</p><p><span><IMG width="652" height="1" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_026.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="488" height="197" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_027.png"/></span></p><h3>Fig. 4   <span class="s1">Meta-classes used for visual simplicity of profile diagrams</span></h3><p><span><IMG width="222" height="156" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_028.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="304" height="170" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_029.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="567" height="219" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_030.png"/></span></p><h2>(a)                                                                                  (b)</h2><p class="s1"><b>Fig. 5   </b>Packages <span class="s13">ContextStereotypes </span>(<b>a</b>) and <span class="s13">ReplicationStereotypes </span>(<b>b</b>)</p><h3>Fig. 6   <span class="s1">Package </span><span class="s13">ConfigurationStereotypes</span></h3><p>the development lifecycle using simple tool support to query the models and generate customized reports. Safety engi- neers can thus obtain regular reports, monitor the progress of implementing safety requirements, and promptly address any concerns. This will put them in position to be better prepared to defend the system’s compliance with DO-178B. For exam- ple, they can use this approach to assess the availability of certification-related information.<br/>Usage 5 in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">2.2 </span>illustrates the need to obtain valuable information from the model that can be submitted to certi- fication authorities. Since the SafeUML conceptual model was based on the DO-178B standard and its requirements, the information captured in SafeUML models should fully address the need to demonstrate compliance with the stan- dard. For example, Section 11 and annex A in the DO-178B<br/>[<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>] standard list the information required for submission to the certification authorities for each software level. This was accounted for and included in the information requirements in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">3.1 </span>and therefore captured in the conceptual model in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">4</span>.<br/>For example, the notions of requirements refinement and derived requirements are very important to DO-178B [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>]. Safety requirements are assigned at a system functional level and then they are refined or decomposed into more detailed requirements, some of which are then assigned to software design elements. Such requirements refinement is an impor- tant aspect of requirements engineering. In addition, the sys- tem development team may introduce new requirements or derive them from the customer requirements and, because they are not explicitly specified by the customer, they are</p><p class="s9">123</p><p class="s1">350                                                                                                                                                                                                      G.

Such derived requirements often result from environmental conditions, standards, or development processes. SafeUML supports such decompo- sition and the modeling of derived requirements through its stereotypes and their attributes. SafeUML has a <span class="s11">«Require- ment» </span>stereotype, which is used to identify a requirement. This stereotype has an attribute called <span class="s11">ofRequirement</span>, which identifies its parent requirement (refinement relation). It also has an attribute called <span class="s11">isDerived</span>, which identifies whether the requirement is a derived one or not. At any point in the  requirements hierarchy, refined or derived require- ments may be traced to higher-level requirements (through the <span class="s11">ofRequirement </span>relationship). For example, Fig. <span style=" color: #00F;">11 </span>shows three safety requirements for an aircraft’s payload release system and their relationships. SREQ 1 specifies that the software system shall safely release payloads from the air-<br/>craft. This requirement is refined in SREQ 1.1, which states that the payload released from the aircraft bay shall not hit the aircraft’s body while being released: SREQ 1.1 is linked to SREQ 1 bya <span class="s11">ofRequirement </span>link. Then, through anal- ysis of the weight of payloads and aircraft, safety engineers use the physics laws of free fall and determine the maximum speed an aircraft may be flying such that the released pay- load does not hit the body. This leads to derived requirement SREQ 1.1.1: Payload shall not be released from the aircraft if its speed is greater than 300 knots; as illustrated by the <span class="s11">is- Derived=true </span>attribute of SREQ 1.1.1. Notice that the derived requirement appears in the form of a constraint (on the speed), which is common in practice.<br/>It should be noted that Appendix <span style=" color: #00F;">A </span>contains the defi- nitions of concepts, their attributes, and their relationships. Since stereotypes and their attributes correspond to concepts,</p><p class="s9">123</p><p class="s1">Modeling safety and airworthiness information                                                                                                                                                      351</p><p><span><IMG width="652" height="1" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_032.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="488" height="221" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_033.png"/></span></p><h3>Fig. 9   <span class="s1">Package </span><span class="s13">EventManagementStereotypes</span></h3><p><span><IMG width="707" height="368" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_034.png"/></span></p><h3>Fig. 10   <span class="s1">SafeUML Relation to DO-178B</span></h3><h3>Fig. 11   <span class="s1">Decomposing/refining safety requirement and derived requirements</span></h3><p>their relations, and their attributes, the reader should refer to<br/>Appendix <span style=" color: #00F;">A </span>for more detailed descriptions.<br/>Table <span style=" color: #00F;">5 </span>provides examples of SafeUML stereotypes and their attributes that can be used to capture information valu- able for DO-178B.

Section <span style=" color: #00F;">6.5 </span>in the case study pro- vides example uses of the stereotypes in Table <span style=" color: #00F;">5</span>.<br/>Finally, it is worth mentioning that reports from model queries do not need to refer to UML terminology and Saf- eUML stereotypes, but can instead be translated into DO-<br/>178B specific terminology since SafeUML stereotypes are traceable to DO-178B concepts. This allows the generated reports to be available in the language and style that safety engineers or certification authorities are used to. This is important because the SafeUML approach should not require them to be experienced in UML, UML extension mecha- nisms, object-orientation, or programming.<br/>5.3 Application of SafeUML to other safety standards<br/>Although SafeUML is intended to be primarily used in the context of DO-178B certification, we made an effort to define a profile as generic as possible by defining the conceptual model and profile on abstract safety concepts instead of DO-<br/>178B specific safety concepts wherever possible. This is an attempt to simplify reusing and tailoring SafeUML to other safety-related standards that are used in other safety-critical industries including health care, transportation, and nuclear energy.<br/>For example, we chose the “Requirement” (C.1) concept, and its corresponding <span class="s11">«Requirement» (S.9) </span>stereo- type, with their attributes, all described in general terms, to represent the following concepts as they appeared in DO-<br/>178B [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>]: Safety Objective (Section 4.1 of [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>]), Safety Requirement (Sections 2.1.1 and 5.1 of [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>]), Certification Requirement   (Section   2.1.1   of   [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>]),   and   Derived</p><p class="s9">123</p><p class="s1">352                                                                                                                                                                                                      G.

Stereo- types and their attributes are shown in a number of class dia- grams to support the discussion.

This case study was developed only to illustrate the UML profile and, due to confidentiality requirements and for keeping complexity within reasonable bounds, it does not exactly correspond to an actual, certified (e.g., by the FAA) system. However, the first author was involved in the devel- opment of similar systems, on which this case study is based, and we followed standard design practices.<br/>The NC subsystem is used to control the aircraft’s flight paths through both automatic pilot and manual input from the pilots. In autopilot mode, the subsystem can choose an appropriate flight path based on the source and destination of the aircraft, and guide the aircraft by generating appropri- ate commands to the aircraft’s ailerons and spoilers (on the wings), rudder (on the vertical tail), and engines to change the speed and heading (i.e., direction) as required. In custom Fly-To-Point (FTP) mode, the subsystem can accept com- mands from the pilots such as a destination’s specific lati- tude and longitude. It then controls the aircraft’s speed and heading to get to the requested destination.<br/>In order to perform such functionality, the NC subsystem needs to have continuous input from the aircraft’s navigation system, which reports the current position and altitude of the aircraft at all times. In addition, it needs to be able to com- mand the aircraft’s ailerons, spoilers, rudders, and engines to change the speed and heading.<br/>To develop the subsystem, we first identified five high- level functional requirements (main functionalities) for the subsystem, referred to as FREQ 1 to FREQ 5. We then per- formed a safety assessment, using four standard, complemen- tary methods (namely, action error analysis, failure modes and effects analysis, hazards and operability analysis, and interface  analysis [<span style=" color: #00F;">16</span>]). This generated 11 safety require- ments, referred to as SREQ 1 to SREQ 7 (SREQ 6 is further<br/>decomposed into SREQ 6.1 to SREQ 6.5). We then designed the subsystem while recording design decisions (in particular safety-related ones) using our profile. Lastly, we evaluated the resulting design documents with respect to the usage sce- narios discussed in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">2.2</span>.<br/>Below we detail the development of the NC subsystem in four steps. We first identify and list the functional and safety requirements of the NC subsystem in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">6.2</span>. Sec- ond, we identify the events the controller subsystem has to handle, and the reactions it has to take, according to the func- tional and safety requirements (Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">6.3</span>). Third, we discuss the design of the subsystem itself (Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">6.4</span>) and we record design decisions using the SafeUML profile. Last, we show how safety engineers and third party certification authorities can use this information (Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">6.5</span>).<br/>6.2 Functional and safety requirements<br/>The  subsystem’s functional and  safety  requirements are described in Table <span style=" color: #00F;">6</span>. We list here the requirements assuming that they have already gone through sufficient refinement and decomposition, and that derived requirements have already been identified and added. In Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">5.2 </span>we showed how doc- umenting them is possible using SafeUML.<br/>6.3 Identification of events and reactions<br/>A standard practice is to identify all the events the NC subsys- tem receives, and the reactions it performs, which could have safety implications. This advocates an Event-Driven Archi- tecture (EDA). To identify the events, one needs to determine which inputs to the system, or changes in its state, may impact its safety. To identify the reactions, one needs to determine how the system should behave to ensure safety when any of the identified events occurs.<br/>Safety requirements can be used to identify such safety- related events and reactions. For example, one can identify at</p><p class="s9">123</p><p class="s1">Modeling safety and airworthiness information                                                                                                                                                      355</p><p><span><IMG width="652" height="1" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_044.png"/></span></p><h3>Table 6  <span class="s1">Functional and safety requirements for the Navigation Controller (NC) subsystem</span></h3><p><span><IMG width="662" height="1" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_045.png"/></span></p><p class="s1">Number                                                  Requirement</p><p><span><IMG width="652" height="1" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_046.png"/></span></p><p class="s1">FREQ 1                                                  <span class="s13">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall be able to list pre-determined flight paths for a requested source/destination pair.</p><p class="s1">FREQ 2                                                  <span class="s13">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall provide an autopilot feature where it flies the aircraft through a requested flight path.</p><p class="s1">FREQ 3                                                  <span class="s13">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall be able to fly the aircraft to a requested Fly-To-Point</p><p class="s1">(FTP).</p><p class="s1">FREQ 4                                                  <span class="s13">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall provide the capability to guide the pilots through a requested flight path when the pilot is controlling the aircraft through <span class="s13">MechanicalSteeringStickSubsystem</span>.</p><p class="s1">FREQ 5                                                  <span class="s13">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall be able to provide navigation information received from</p><p class="s13">NavigationSubsystem<span class="s1">.</span></p><p class="s1">SREQ 1                                                  <span class="s13">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall disable autopilot and FTP features when the pilot is using <span class="s13">MechanicalSteeringStickSubsystem</span>, and re-enable them when the pilot stops using <span class="s13">MechanicalSteeringStickSubsystem</span>.</p><p class="s1">SREQ 2                                                  <span class="s13">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall be able to identify whether a specific LAT/LONG position is in a safe area or not, and not fly the aircraft to unsafe positions unless explicitly confirmed by the pilot.</p><p class="s1">SREQ 3                                                  <span class="s13">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall be able to determine whether flying to a specific LAT/LONG position requires flying through unsafe areas or not, and not fly the aircraft through unsafe areas unless explicitly confirmed by the pilot.</p><p class="s1">SREQ 4                                                  <span class="s13">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall alert the pilot when the next FTP cannot be reached without having to refuel the aircraft.</p><p class="s1">SREQ 5                                                  When <span class="s13">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>fails, an alert shall be raised and, until <span class="s13">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>is operational again, the pilot shall be required to manually fly the aircraft using <span class="s13">MechanicalSteeringStickSubsystem</span>.</p><p class="s1">SREQ 6                                                  <span class="s13">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>shall ensure that the autopilot and FTP features are enabled only when all of the following conditions hold.</p><p class="s1">SREQ 6.1                                               <span class="s13">WingsAndEnginesSubsystem</span>is functional.

Also from this requirement, one can identify at least the fol- lowing reactions: (1) Disabling the autopilot when the pilot starts  using  the mechanical and steering stick subsystem; (2) Enabling the autopilot when the pilot stops using this subsystem.<br/>Such analysis led to the identification of an inheritance hierarchy of event classes (stereotyped <span class="s11">«Event» (S.21)) </span>and an inheritance hierarchy of reaction classes (stereotyped</p><p class="s11">«Reaction» (S.22)<span class="p">).

The</p><p class="s11">«Event» <span class="p">(S.21) stereotype has two attributes: one provides</span></p><p>information on  the  impact  of  system  safety  due  to  the subsystem’s  receipt  of  the  event  (<span class="s11">EffectOnSafety- Direction</span>), and the other provides some context under</p><p class="s9">123</p><p class="s1">356                                                                                                                                                                                                      G.

The  <span class="s11">«Reaction» (S.22) </span>stereotype has a number of attributes to: refer to the event(s) that the reaction is a conse- quence of (<span class="s11">ConsequenceOf</span>), whether it increases (<span class="s11">Pos- itive</span>) or decreases (<span class="s11">Negative</span>) the level of software sys- tem safety (<span class="s11">EffectOnSafetyDirection</span>), and indicate the condition(s) under which the reaction occurs (<span class="s11">When</span>). For example, when connections to the relevant subsystems are restored, the <span class="s11">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>is re-enabled and it resumes controlling them. This is docu- mented in Fig. <span style=" color: #00F;">13 </span>through the <span class="s11">EnableController </span>reac- tion, which can be triggered by the <span class="s11">HeadingAndSpeed- NotControlledByOtherSubsystems </span>event    (tag <span class="s11">ConsequenceOf</span>) when <i>connections are available to func- tional subsystem </i>(tag <span class="s11">When</span>), and this has a <i>positive </i>effect on system safety (tag <span class="s11">EffectOnSafetyDirection</span>) (in addition, it is possible to use the <span class="s11">EffectOnSafetyValue </span>tag to quantify the change in safety). Fig. <span style=" color: #00F;">13 </span>also illustrates that reactions <span class="s11">DisableController </span>and <span class="s11">EnableCon- troller </span>are also  consequences of events other than the one previously mentioned (e.g., <span class="s11">HeadingAndSpeedCon- nectionEstablished</span>).<br/>The   two   <span class="s11">«Reaction» (S.22) </span>classes   are   also<br/>stereotyped <span class="s11">«Rationale» (S.14) </span>to record the design decisions for including them. The <span class="s11">«Rationale» (S.14) </span>stereotype has an attribute, namely <span class="s11">Reference</span>, to refer to the requirements that justify the existence of the reactions (here, safety requirements SREQ 1 and SREQ 6).<br/>6.4 Navigation Controller subsystem design: usage scenarios 1, 2, 3<br/>The NC subsystem design (class diagram) appears in the <span class="s11">NavigationControllerSubsystem </span>package    in Fig. <span style=" color: #00F;">14</span>, and selected stereotypes are applied to the model for illustrative purposes. The diagram (i.e., package) itself is stereotyped <span class="s11">«SafetyContext» (S.16) </span>to specify that it contains information that is relevant to system safety. It is also stereotyped <span class="s11">«Requirement» (S.9) </span>to indicate the functional and safety requirements that are relevant to the  diagram (attributes <span class="s11">Kind </span>and <span class="s11">Specification</span>). In this case, the stereotypes indicate that the design fulfills all requirements.<br/>Class    <span class="s11">Controller </span>is    also    stereotyped    with<br/><span class="s11">«Handler» (S.23) </span>with   attribute   <span class="s11">Handleable- Event </span>equal to <span class="s11">PilotInputEvent </span>to indicate that it handles  all  concrete  events  that  are  subclasses of  class <span class="s11">PilotInputEvent</span>(stereotyped <span class="s11">«Event» (S.21)</span>, but not shown in Fig. <span style=" color: #00F;">13</span>). In addition to functional features (e.g., changing the flight path in response to a <span class="s11">ChangeFlight- Path </span>input event), <span class="s11">Controller </span>is also responsible for safety features such as executing the <span class="s11">InvestigateFu- elShortage </span>reaction (attribute of <span class="s11">«Handler»</span>) to deter- mine whether the changes requested by the pilots may result in a fuel shortage or not.<br/>Class   <span class="s11">Controller </span>is   also   stereotyped   <span class="s11">«state dependent control»</span>, indicating it is a control class with a state-dependent behavior.

The <span class="s11">«Monitor» (S.24)</span>stereotype indicates that those monitors are safety monitors (<span class="s11">Kind </span>attri- bute is set to <span class="s11">Safety</span>). It also specifies the monitored entity (attribute <span class="s11">MonitoredEntity</span>), the detectable event from this entity (attribute <span class="s11">DetectableEvent</span>), and the handler for those events (attribute <span class="s11">EventHandler</span>). In particular, referring to the already discussed safety requirement SREQ<br/>1,  class  <span class="s11">HeadingAndSpeedMonitor </span>monitors  class <span class="s11">HeadingAndSpeedInterface </span>to  detect <span class="s11">Heading- AndSpeedEvent </span>(attribute <span class="s11">DetectableEvent</span>), and therefore   its   event   subclasses   <span class="s11">HeadingAndSpeed- ControlledByOtherSubsystem</span>and <span class="s11">HeadingAnd- SpeedNotControlledByOtherSubsystem </span>events (Fig.   <span style=" color: #00F;">9</span>),  and  then  notifies  <span class="s11">ExternalSubsystems- EventHandler </span>that triggers the <span class="s11">DisableController </span>or   <span class="s11">EnableController </span>reactions  accordingly.

This is apparent through the use of SafeUML stereotypes in Figs. <span style=" color: #00F;">13</span><br/>and  <span style=" color: #00F;">14</span>, and the extensive explanation provided here. The next section will illustrate how such a SafeUML design model in this case study can support safety engineering and certi- fication by providing case study examples on information required  for safety monitoring (Usage 4) and certification (Usage 5), thus also illustrating SafeUML benefits to safety engineers.<br/>6.5 Safety analysis and certification based on design models: usage scenarios 4, 5<br/>In this section, we illustrate, using the NC subsystem case study, how Usage 4 and Usage 5 discussed in Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">2.2 </span>(Fig. <span style=" color: #00F;">1</span>) can be facilitated through the use of SafeUML models. In Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">5.2</span>, we extensively discussed the benefits of modeling using SafeUML for DO-178B and safety monitoring, and we presented several examples of DO-178B guidelines and how using SafeUML helps engineers satisfy them. In the previous section, we presented concrete examples from the SafeUML model in this case study (Figs. <span style=" color: #00F;">13</span>, <span style=" color: #00F;">14</span>) to illustrate the ben- efits for Usage 1, Usage 2, and Usage 3. In this section, we provide examples on the benefits for Usage 4 and Usage 5.<br/>Recall that a project’s PSAC (Plan for Software Aspects of Certification) is required to include a description of soft- ware’s contributions to failure conditions (see Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">5.2</span>). This is in essence software levels, which can be obtained by que- rying the model for all the model elements with the <span class="s11">«Saf- etyCritical» </span>stereotype and reading their <span class="s11">Critical- ityLevel </span>attribute.<br/>Further, the software level for each component or ele-<br/>ment must be as high as the highest level for all elements that depend on it. From Fig. <span style=" color: #00F;">13</span>, we can extract a list of safety-critical elements and failure condition category level (using stereotype <span class="s11">«SafetyCritical»</span>). Notice that the software level for each element is at least equal to the high- est level for all elements that depend on it. This is summa- rized in Table <span style=" color: #00F;">7</span>. This allows safety engineers and certification authorities (Usage 4 and Usage 5) to ensure that DO-178B guidelines with respect to software level design rules were followed in Usage 2 and Usage 3. For example (Table <span style=" color: #00F;">7</span>), <span class="s11">NavigationSubsystem </span>has level B, which is higher than the levels for both elements that depend on it, namely,</p><p class="s9">123</p><p class="s1">Modeling safety and airworthiness information                                                                                                                                                      359</p><p><span><IMG width="652" height="1" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_058.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="1" height="878" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_059.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="1" height="879" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_060.png"/></span><br/><span><IMG width="1" height="878" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_061.png"/></span></p><p class="s11">NavigationControllerSubsystem <span class="p">(level  C)  and</span></p><p class="s11">LEDDisplaySubsystem <span class="p">(level D).</span></p><p><span><IMG width="1" height="673" src="Modeling safety and airworthiness RTCA DO-178B information    conceptual model and UML profile/Image_062.png"/></span><br/>Recall that a project’s PSAC is required to include a description of the hardware/software interfaces in the system (Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">5.2</span>): DO-178B places special emphasis on this, espe- cially on interfaces between hardware and software. From Fig. <span style=" color: #00F;">14</span>, we can extract such a list, using stereotype <span class="s11">«Inter- face»</span>, to support Usage 4 and Usage 5, and identify hard- ware/software interfaces if they were documented in Usage<br/>3 (Table <span style=" color: #00F;">8</span>). <span class="s11">NavigationInterface</span>, for examples, is a software class to interface with the <span class="s11">NavigationSubsys- tem </span>hardware subsystem (Table <span style=" color: #00F;">8</span>).<br/>Recall that a project’s PSAC is required to include a doc- umentation of requirements and their traceability through design (Sect. <span style=" color: #00F;">5.2</span>). From Fig. <span style=" color: #00F;">14</span>, we can extract such a list. This  will  help  ensure  that  all  safety  requirements  are designed   through   the   software   (through   stereotypes<br/><span class="s11">«Requirement»</span>, <span class="s11">«Rationale»</span>). Table <span style=" color: #00F;">9</span>, generated from the model, helps the safety engineer conclude that all safety requirements are addressed by some design while mon- itoring safety (Usage 4). Further, this traceability informa- tion can be submitted to certification authorities (Usage 5) to illustrate requirements traceability from requirements to design (i.e., which design elements, with their correspond- ing implementation code, trace to which requirements). For example, from Table <span style=" color: #00F;">9 </span>we can conclude that <span class="s11">HeadingAnd- SpeedMonitor </span>and <span class="s11">ExternalSubsystemsEvent- Handler </span>implement SREQ 1 and that all functional and safety requirements are designed into the system. If some requirements were not designed into any design element, then safety engineers can raise a flag and software engineers can further investigate to resolve this.<br/>To help safety engineers monitor safety (Usage 4), it is possible to extract a list of safety-critical events and how they   will   be   handled   (using   stereotypes   <span class="s11">«Event»</span>,</p><p class="s11">«Reaction»<span class="p">, </span>«Monitor»<span class="p">, </span>«Handler»<span class="p">). This informa-</span></p><p>tion can be extracted from Fig. <span style=" color: #00F;">14</span>, as summarized in Table <span style=" color: #00F;">10 </span>that lists events, reactions, monitors, handlers, and classes that raise events. Notice that Table <span style=" color: #00F;">10 </span>does not specify which design elements raise and detect the <span class="s11">PilotInputEvent </span>event (empty cells), which suggests that software engineers did not record and justify some relevant decisions for the cor- responding safety requirements or reactions (missing activity in Usage 3). This may be because software engineers did not embed safety requirements in the design (missing activity in Usage 2).</p><h2>7 Conclusion</h2><p>Communication and collaboration among safety stakehold- ers, namely safety engineers, software engineers, and certi- fication authorities, was found to be a major challenge when</p><p class="s9">123</p><p class="s1">360                                                                                                                                                                                                      G.

In addition, communication with certifica- tion authorities with regards to system certification requires providing proof that appropriate standards were followed during the development process. To help resolve those chal- lenges, we focused our research on the civil and military aerospace systems development using RTCA DO-178B [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>]. We first identified and modeled, from the DO-178B [<span style=" color: #00F;">30</span>] standard, the information that both engineering groups have to exchange and how they would use such information in practice (usage  scenarios): safety engineers communicate safety requirements to software engineers, software engi- neers design software with system safety in mind and record design decisions, safety engineers monitor system safety dur- ing design and prepare reports for certification. We modeled this information as a conceptual model with 26 safety-related concepts, 48 attributes, and 35 relationships between con- cepts. Although primarily focusing on developing software for the aerospace industry, those concepts would also be reus- able for other safety-critical industries.<br/>To embed safety information in UML models, the de facto standard for modeling object-oriented software, we defined information requirements from the conceptual model. We then evaluated the suitability of existing UML-based solu- tions (e.g., existing profiles). Our conclusion was that exist- ing UML-based solutions are far from being adequate for our purpose, as they only capture a small portion of the safety concepts in our conceptual model. We therefore defined our own UML profile, SafeUML, composed of 31 stereotypes and 79 attributes, focusing first on adding safety information to class diagrams.<br/>SafeUML was applied on a realistic case study, an air- craft’s navigation controller subsystem that can control the aircraft’s flight paths through both automatic pilot and man- ual input from the pilots. This showed how SafeUML is used<br/>within the usage scenarios for safety information that we identified. We designed the controller subsystem using the SafeUML profile, i.e., embedding safety information in the model, following guidance specified in the DO-178B stan- dard  (e.g., we performed a safety analysis of the control- ler subsystem). We then showed that the SafeUML profile can indeed facilitate communication among software engi- neers, safety engineers, and certification authorities. Com- munication with certification authorities is further supported by SafeUML’s ability to provide reports proving that DO-<br/>178B requirements were followed during the development process.<br/>Future work should first focus on (1) providing full auto- mation for the profile including defining a list of common model queries required for certification under the DO-178B standard, (2) extending it to other diagrams such as sequence diagrams and state machines to help analyze the safety behav- ioral aspects of the systems (e.g., sequences of events and reactions), (3) further evaluating its cost and effectiveness in practice through additional case studies, and (4) evaluation of SafeUML profile suitability to other safety-related standards such as in IEC 61508 [<span style=" color: #00F;">13</span>].</p><h3>Acknowledgments   <span class="s1">This work was performed within the framework of Gregory Zoughbi’s Master’s thesis.

Examples: “High”, “Medium”, “Low”, “80%”, “50%”, … etc</span></p><h3>(C.8) Partition<span class="s1">: identifies a design partition that resulted from separating some design element from other design elements. Partitioning is a technique for providing isolation between functionally independent entities to contain and/or isolate faults and potentially reduce the effort of the verification process.
